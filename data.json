To improve the efficiency of such teaching, this paper proposes an information fusion model based on big data resource scheduling for online courses. The design incorporates a software platform built in an embedded Linux environment, including several key modules such as the database module, multimedia information resource sampling module, embedded program processing module, and multimedia human-machine interaction control module.The platform aims to enhance teaching and learning experiences in college physical education by offering students an interactive and comprehensive learning environment. Key components of the platform design include the user interface, the database module, and the information fusion model. The platform utilizes Excel and Access technology for data collection and database construction within the open education system. Additionally, a quantitative recursive analysis method is applied to design the algorithm for multimedia network teaching information fusion and scheduling under a linear programming model.The algorithm integrates into the platform using the instruction dynamic loading module, which loads it into the system control terminal and the information processing center. After successful loading, the algorithm is executed for various tasks related to information fusion and scheduling. This feature allows for the efficient management of resources and data.Furthermore, the platform supports cross-compilation and multi-mode control of multimedia network teaching information in a cloud computing environment. By combining embedded software design techniques, the software development of the management platform is realized. The results demonstrate that the platform's multi-mode integration and scheduling abilities are enhanced, and its real-time retrieval and access capabilities are stronger, thereby improving the quality of multimedia network teaching in college sports."}, {"paperId": "00041b17a6023fd9e394a08a18a45e011f142c86", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00041b17a6023fd9e394a08a18a45e011f142c86", "title": "Semantic Scan Context: Global Semantic Descriptor for LiDAR-based Place Recognition", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/RCAR52367.2021.9517367?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/RCAR52367.2021.9517367, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Recently, emerging researches focus on incorporating geometry features to achieve accurate and view-invariant relocalization in outdoor environment. However, the ambiguity of geometry features occurs in the scenes with similar objects. To address this problem, we propose Semantic Scan Context, a noval global descriptor based on 3D LiDAR scans and static semantic information such as trunks, poles, traffic signs, buildings, roads and sidewalks. This descriptor not only records the geometrical structure of a 3D LiDAR scan, but also encodes the semantic distribution information. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine hierarchical retrieval method to realize the efficient matching for the proposed descriptors. We define three distances to measure the similarity of two places. By weighted sum of these three distances, revisited places can be exactly determined. The recall-precision curve of proposed method is evaluated on public datasets and compared with existing methods. The experimental results proof that our method achieves a competitive re-identification performance."}, {"paperId": "0005e91817c937b5ed5edf3378bd61692a161e92", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005e91817c937b5ed5edf3378bd61692a161e92", "title": "\u0391\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03be\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03be\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd, \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0399\u039f\u0399", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "83516555", "name": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0006087c3aca322dad188bdad8b8729a96d6255d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0006087c3aca322dad188bdad8b8729a96d6255d", "title": "A Land and Ocean Microwave Cloud Classi\ufb01cation Algorithm Derived from AMSU-A and -B, Trained Using MSG-SEVIRI Infrared and Visible Observations", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2261139782", "name": "F.

Although it is related to other information retrieval tasks, it needs to bridge the gaps between the language used in the code (which is usually syntax-specific and logic-specific) and the natural language which is more suitable for describing ambiguous concepts and ideas. Existing approaches study code retrieval in a natural language for a specific programming language, however it is unwieldy and often requires a large amount of corpus for each language when dealing with multilingual scenarios.Using knowledge distillation of six existing monolingual Teacher Models to train one Student Model\u2014MPLCS (Multi-Programming Language Code Search), this paper proposed a method to support multi-programing language code search tasks. MPLCS has the ability to incorporate multiple languages into one model with low corpus requirements. MPLCS can study the commonality between different programming languages and improve the recall accuracy for small dataset code languages. As for Ruby used in this paper, MPLCS improved its MRR score by 20 to 25%. In addition, MPLCS can compensate the low recall accuracy of monolingual models when perform language retrieval work on other programming languages. And in some cases, MPLCS\u2019 recall accuracy can even outperform the recall accuracy of monolingual models when they perform language retrieval work on themselves."}, {"paperId": "00072f626cb04acf6943ba6262299f4090deb6e5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00072f626cb04acf6943ba6262299f4090deb6e5", "title": "View on the Buildup of New Service Capability of National Library of China From the Point of Development Trend of Reference Work", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.igi-global.com/ViewTitle.aspx?TitleId=265291&isxn=9781799863304", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4018/ijlis.2021010105?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4018/ijlis.2021010105, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This chapter presents an efficient method of retrieving images from an image database. This system combines color, shape and spatial features to index and measure the similarity of images. Several color spaces that are widely used in computer graphics are discussed and compared for color clustering. In addition, this chapter proposes a new automatic indexing scheme of image databases according to our clustering method and color sensation, which could be used to retrieve images efficiently. As a technical contribution, a Seed-Filling like algorithm that could extract the shape and spatial relationship feature of an image is proposed. Due to the difficulty of determining how far objects are separated, this system uses qualitative spatial relations to analyze object similarity. Also, the system is incorporated with a visual interface and a set of tools, which allows the users to express the query by specifying or sketching the images conveniently. The feedback learning mechanism enhances the precision of retrieval. The experience shows that the system is able to retrieve image information efficiently by the proposed approaches."}, {"paperId": "000803b588a1e44175d80f200e6e90b96f7ab6f0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000803b588a1e44175d80f200e6e90b96f7ab6f0", "title": "Preface to special issue on string processing and information retrieval (SPIRE)", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145876066", "name": "F.

A column-based multi-layer snow hydrology model which includes the grain size evolution is coupled with the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT-QMS). The snow variables are then updated by an ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm to incorporate information from microwave observations. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of SWE remote sensing taking advantage of multi-source data fusion in a data assimilation framework. An SWE retrieval (per 4 hours) RMSE of 25.81mm is achieved, which meets the international standard such as NASA SCLP and ESA CoReH2O and is 62.25% lower than that of open-loop hydrology model prediction.

Methods: The literature retrieval for all the Chinese and English guidelines published before September 1st, 2020 was conducted by using Chinese/English databases, such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Guideline International Network, and supplement with the official website of multiple regions, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Cancer Society. We utilized The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation \u2161 (AGREE \u2161) and Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) approaches to assess the quality of CRC screening guidelines/consensus comprehensively. Results: After quality control, a total of 19 guidelines/consensus released by the United States, China, Australia, Canada, Britain, South Korea, and International organizations are successfully included, and strikingly, most of those belong to the United State(7). The results of the AGREE \u2161 quality evaluation show that the average scores of scope and purpose (87.5%) and clarity of presentation (89.6%) are high. In contrast, there are deficient in stakeholder involvement (47.0%), the rigor of development (42.3%), applicability (47.5%), and editorial independence (50.2%). Among all the guidelines, there are 12 with an overall score of 50 or more, 13 with a recommendation level of \"A\", 2 with a rating of \"B\" and 4 with a rating of \"C\". Additionally, the RIGHT evaluation revealed that the average report rate in each field is necessary information (76.3%), background (77.0%), evidence (55.8%), recommendations (59.4%), review and quality assurance (26.3%), funding and declaration and management of interests (43.4%), other information (49.1%). Among all the guidelines, six have good reporting quality, whereas the additional 13 have general or weak evidence. Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicates that the quality of guidelines in developed countries is superior to that of China. Conclusion: The number of CRC screening guidelines/consensus is increasing gradually, and the overall quality of those is high, but the normative nature is warranted to be strengthened."}, {"paperId": "000b7721e739b341feb97862facd48c7d1cc2dad", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b7721e739b341feb97862facd48c7d1cc2dad", "title": "SciNet: a system for browsing scientific literature through keyword manipulation", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Outstanding examples are provided by germanium for wavelengths less than 1.5 microns and information bandwidth to 30 MHz, indium arsenide to 3.4 microns and the same bandwidth, and indium antimonide to 5 microns and hundreds of MHz. Theoretical analysis of the photocurrent gain-bandwidth product shows it to be controlled by two important parameters: the ratio of electric field in the sample to the root of the microwave energy stored in the cavity, and the saturated drift velocity in the semiconductor. Measured performance is in quantitative agreement with the theoretical expression. The system requires only a few milliwatts of microwave power to drive the carriers to saturated velocity; the signal is extracted with a conventional microwave receiver. A retrieval efficiency beta is introduced to compare the performance of broad-band detectors, whose significance for solid-state detectors is analogous to that of the quantum efficiency alpha for a photomultiplier. Large beta means increased SNR; when beta reaches alpha, the device can count individual quanta. Measured values of beta for the devices studied reach 10 percent for germanium under certain conditions, a value approached only by the avalanche diode and more than two orders of magnitude higher than has been reported for other solid-state detectors. Comparison of the values of NEP and of (D*) with those of other infrared detectors shows a very large improvement in NEP and an important increase in (D*). The latter ranges from 3 \u00d7 1014for germanium to almost 1012(BLIP condition) for indium antimonide, and NEP ranges from 2 \u00d7 10-17for germanium to 2 \u00d7 10-14for indium antimonide. For both materials and also silicon, the gain-bandwidth product is about 1010; for indium arsenide the screening by free carriers reduces it to 109Hz. Noise studies reveal a large 1/f component. While its source has not been defined completely, the indication is that it can be significantly reduced by improvements in the microwave circuit. There seems to be no serious barrier to constructing photoconductive detectors which are shot-noise-limited and can count photons with high efficiency."}, {"paperId": "000cfeb8f6a20e185789c60f22e4e73aa822f0e9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cfeb8f6a20e185789c60f22e4e73aa822f0e9", "title": "The implementation of hybrid codes and nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processing", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150301757", "name": "Shayan Majidy"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "000d43b6466fc767d9c9aa9511e549cbe7eb4094", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d43b6466fc767d9c9aa9511e549cbe7eb4094", "title": "Scale and Topology Preserving SIFT Feature Hashing", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

To gain a better understanding of how and why users interact with information resources and tools during a creative process, we conducted a two-week diary study with 11 participants. We recorded their information seeking behavior through a combination of diary entries, data logging, and reflective interviews. Our analysis identified five common reasons for how people use existing information resources (e.g., search engines, video sites, image sites, Q&A sites, and other social sites) to support their creative process. We also report on how different information resources were preferred for different purposes at different creative stages. For instance, participants often used images to help support ideation, Q&A sites to learn from other creators and to find tips and recommendations, and social media to select ideas and collect feedback on their creative projects. We also identified challenges participants faced when working on their creative projects. Our findings provide insights for the future design of search engines, improvement of search algorithms, and the development of novel tools to support users during different creative stages."}, {"paperId": "001182850be0bea8f3a625d610add4aa3914310a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001182850be0bea8f3a625d610add4aa3914310a", "title": "Analysis on the Construction of University Students' Information Retrieval Ability", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1413999715", "name": "Wu Xin-b"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0011a76d8e02d825b3ff3066850e8135d05a1c02", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011a76d8e02d825b3ff3066850e8135d05a1c02", "title": "Context injection in expert finding", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3539637.3556995?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3539637.3556995, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, scalability is hindered by the growing complexity of solutions, mainly due to the abstract nature of fine-grained sketches. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to narrow the gap between the two domains. It mainly facilitates unified mutual information sharing both intra- and inter-samples, rather than treating them as a single feature alignment problem between modalities. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) Employing dual weight-sharing networks to optimize alignment within the sketch and image domain, which also effectively mitigates model learning saturation issues. (ii) Introducing an objective optimization function based on contrastive loss to enhance the model's ability to align features in both intra- and inter-samples. (iii) Presenting a self-supervised Multi-Scale Token Recycling (MSTR) Module featured by recycling discarded patch tokens in multi-scale features, further enhancing representation capability and retrieval performance. Our framework achieves excellent results on CNN- and ViT-based backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. We also introduce Cloths-V1, the first professional fashion sketch-image dataset, utilized to validate our method and will be beneficial for other applications."}, {"paperId": "0012e189a719cc29c3fb1ac597286e9052c0ba82", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0012e189a719cc29c3fb1ac597286e9052c0ba82", "title": "The simulation of verbal learning behavior", "year": 1899, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1460690.1460704", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Although snow depth on sea ice is a key parameter for sea ice thickness (SIT) retrieval, there currently does not exist reliable estimations.\nIn the Arctic, nearly all SIT products use a snow depth climatology (the modified Warren-99 climatology, W99m) constructed from in\u00a0situ data obtained prior to the first significant impacts of climate change.\nIn the Antarctic, the lack of information on snow depth remains a major obstacle in the development of reliable SIT products. In this study, we present the latest version of the altimetric snow depth (ASD) product computed over both hemispheres from the difference of the radar penetration into the snow pack between the Ka-band frequency SARAL/Altika and the Ku-band frequency CryoSat-2.\nThe ASD solution is compared against a wide range of snow depth products including model data (Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) or its equivalent in the Antarctic the Global Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (GIOMAS), the MERCATOR model, and NASA's Eulerian Snow On Sea Ice Model (NESOSIM, only in the Arctic)), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) passive radiometer data, and the Dual-altimeter Snow Thickness (DuST) Ka\u2013Ku product (only in the Arctic).\nThe ASD product is further validated in the Arctic against the ice mass balance (IMB) buoys, the CryoSat Validation Experiment (CryoVEx) and Operation Ice Bridge's (OIB) airborne measurements.\nThese comparisons demonstrate that ASD is a relevant snow depth solution, with spatiotemporal patterns consistent with those of the alternative Ka\u2013Ku DuST product but with a mean bias of about 6.5\u2009cm.\nWe also demonstrate that ASD is consistent with the validation data:\ncomparisons with OIB's airborne snow radar in the Arctic during the period of 2014\u20132018 show a correlation of 0.66 and a RMSE of about 6\u2009cm.\nFurthermore, a first-guess monthly climatology has been constructed in the Arctic from the ASD product, which shows a good agreement with OIB during 2009\u20132012.\nThis climatology is shown to provide a better solution than the W99m climatology when compared with validation data.\nFinally, we have characterised the SIT uncertainty due to the snow depth from an ensemble of SIT solutions computed for the Arctic by using the different snow depth products previously used in the comparison with the ASD product.\nDuring the period of 2013\u20132019, we found a spatially averaged SIT mean standard deviation of 20\u2009cm.\nDeviations between SIT estimations due to snow depths can reach up to 77\u2009cm. Using the ASD data instead of W99m to estimate SIT over this time period leads to a reduction in the average SIT of about 30\u2009cm.\n"}, {"paperId": "0013a9f0d6260d6d7ee97e1388f9b3ebca39bb54", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013a9f0d6260d6d7ee97e1388f9b3ebca39bb54", "title": "Distributed Intelligent Agents", "year": 1996, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/64.546581?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/64.546581, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

I the availability and improving the quality of surface water in south Florida by temporarily fl ooding previously drained pastureland is one of the goals of Northern Everglades Restoration Initiative (Dahm et al., 1995; Shukla, 2004). However, fl ooding can have catastrophic impacts on the productivity of grassland pastures in south Florida, as most forage species are intolerant to excess water. In grasslands, waterlogging is frequently associated with other stresses, such as grazing, which may require specifi c and very diff erent adaptive strategies and management (Naidoo and Mundree, 1993; Rubio et al., 1995). Th ese adaptive strategies are not well understood and may still warrant extended investigations. Th e negative impact of fl ooding on terrestrial plant could be a consequence of the slow diff usion rates of gases in water compared with in air and low solubility of O2 in water (Jackson, 1985; Gaynard and Armstrong, 1987; Crawford, 1992; Armstrong et al., 1994; Armstrong and Drew, 2002; Voesenek et al., 2006). Plants vary in their ability to withstand fl ooding and this undoubtedly contributes to their ecological distribution (Crawford, 1993). Th ere are two distinctly diff erent strategies that plants employ to survive fl ooding: tolerance of anoxia and avoidance of anoxia. Anoxia tolerance involves metabolic adaptation and varies among species, plants, and tissues. Anoxia avoidance requires the development of mechanisms to deliver oxygen to the roots through internal channels. Plants that adopt this mechanism have modifi ed patterns of growth and are not necessarily tolerant to low atmospheric oxygen levels (Jackson and Drew, 1984). Other plants possess the ability to develop a combination of mechanisms enabling them to grow under waterlogged conditions (Kozlowski, 1984). Anaerobic conditions inhibit almost immediately the transport of nutrient ions by roots (Luttge and Pitman, 1976). Th is may be due to insuffi cient energy to maintain the activity of ion pumps. Phloem unloading in the anaerobic root ceases and transport of metabolites and growth regulators between the root and shoot are therefore impeded. Particularly little is known about the response of forage species to the combined eff ect of waterlogging and the addition of nutrients (e.g., N and P). In fl ooded rice (Oryza sativa L.), positive growth responses to soil nutrient enrichment have been found (Carter et al., 1986). Th is suggests that fertilizer application may reverse the detrimental processes associated with fl ooding; relatively few studies and reports are available on the ability of N fertilizer to counteract the deleterious eff ects of waterlogging on terrestrial plants (Drew et al., 1979; Hodgson, 1982). Th e use of N fertilizer before fl ooding may alleviate N ABSTRACT"}, {"paperId": "00173d0bc3958ecf597fcd7f0a6ee4897edadc0f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00173d0bc3958ecf597fcd7f0a6ee4897edadc0f", "title": "Cyberspace Information Retrieval and Processing with the Use of the Deep Web", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3174427", "name": "Jacek Unold"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0017605cd42472c99e624c719eed6ffbc364149b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0017605cd42472c99e624c719eed6ffbc364149b", "title": "POS-based Classification and Derivation of Kannada Stop-words using English Parallel Corpus", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/incet54531.2022.9825429?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/incet54531.2022.9825429, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Users are usually interested by products which satisfy their needs at the best prices and quality of service .Hence, user\u2019s needs concerns not only one service but many competitive services at the same time. However, for commercial reasons, there is no way to compare all web services products. Each web service is a black box which accepts queries through its own query interface and returns results. As consequence, users ask separately different web services and spend a lot of time comparing products in order to find the best one. This is a burden for novice users. In this paper, the authors propose a new approach which integrates query interfaces of many web services into one universal web service. The new interface describes visually the universal query and is used to ask many web services at the same time.

Prompt evolvement and use of sophisticated protocols make it difficult for security agencies to identify and investigate these activities by conventional methods. Moreover, tracing criminals and terrorists poses a great challenge keeping in mind that cybercrimes are no less serious than real life crimes. At the same time, computer security societies and law enforcement pay a great deal of attention on detecting and monitoring illegal sites on the Dark Web. Retrieval of relevant information is not an easy task because of vastness and ever-changing nature of the Dark Web; as a result, web crawlers play a vital role in achieving this task. Thereafter, data mining techniques are applied to extract useful patterns that would help security agencies to limit and get rid of cybercrimes. The aim of this paper is to present a survey for those researchers who are interested in this topic. We started by discussing the internet layers and the properties of the Deep Web, followed by explaining the technical characters of The Onion Routing (TOR) network, and finally describing the approaches of accessing, extracting and processing Dark Web data. Understanding the Dark Web, its properties and its threats is vital for internet servers; we do hope this paper be of help in that goal."}, {"paperId": "00192c7e77b3291470571c1b741a9242eb65e913", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00192c7e77b3291470571c1b741a9242eb65e913", "title": "Decidability Results on a Query Language for Data Bases with Incomplete Informations", "year": 1980, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

We investigated whether retrieval opportunities also enhance contextualized word learning. In two within\u2010subjects experiments, participants encoded 24 foreign words and then read a story to further strengthen word knowledge. The story contained eight target words in a retrieval context, which required participants to recall word meaning from memory to understand the text (e.g., \u201cShe borrowed a knyga \u201d), and eight target words in an inference context from which meaning could be inferred (e.g., \u201cShe read a knyga \u201d [book]). After 1 to 2 days, a posttest measured word retention. Reading the words in either the retrieval or inference context increased retention, compared to control words not included in the story. Moreover, in Experiment 1, retention was significantly higher in the inference than in the retrieval condition. In Experiment 2, in which encoding before reading was more extensive and feedback was available, no differences in retention were found between the inference and retrieval + feedback condition (both increased retention, compared to control words). Overall, the findings suggest that the benefits of retrieval may be less pronounced during incidental, contextualized learning than during intentional exercises and that retrieval success must be considered when adding retrieval opportunities to contextualized learning. Under low retrieval success, the better comprehension afforded by an informative context may outweigh the benefits of retrieval opportunities (Exp.1). Yet even when retrieval success was enhanced and feedback was added (Exp. 2), retrieval opportunities were only as beneficial as exposure to rich contextual information."}, {"paperId": "0019a56324833f68dd1452b43eae6fdff5677c99", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019a56324833f68dd1452b43eae6fdff5677c99", "title": "Taming Web Sources with \"Minute-Made\" Wrappers", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0019c06523d37ab872a559fffc4f3c5acb2f8f42", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019c06523d37ab872a559fffc4f3c5acb2f8f42", "title": "IR-n System, a Passage Retrieval Architecture", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

This study analyzes the top themes on which health sciences librarians published from 2016 to 2020 by examining the frequency of keywords. Keywords and subject headings were analyzed from The Journal of the Medical Library Association, Medical References Services Quarterly, The Journal of Hospital Librarianship, and The Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries. A total of 8,806 keywords were downloaded for analysis and organized into 292 categories during taxonomy creation. The ten most frequent themes were: libraries, information, education, humans, demography, librarian, geographical locations, research, electronic resources, and technology.

By extracting the attention information with the frequency-temporal attention and performing additive fusion of features, the combined frequency-temporal attention is obtained.

STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set."}, {"paperId": "001cf2cb87173af02bb718e59cb4b41427370ebb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001cf2cb87173af02bb718e59cb4b41427370ebb", "title": "Deliverable D16.2 MPA2 Conceptual Search", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "001d2648bc4bbe002599d780233b9cde3c1a65aa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d2648bc4bbe002599d780233b9cde3c1a65aa", "title": "Exploiting label dependency and feature similarity for multi-label classification", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In this paper, we propose a vectorization-based approach, which exploits weighted n-gram statistical features and improved Cascade Forest approach to conduct accurate language identification of social media short texts. In order to classify a line of text, our approach firstly represents it by a fix-length feature vector, and then leverages a supervised classifier to assign a proper language to it. We implement our approach and conduct extensive evaluations on real-world social texts. The results show that our approach achieves better accuracy, precision and recall rates when compared with the state-of-art machine learning algorithms and off-the-shelf approaches.

As the user uploads the wing image of moth, the system will extract wing image from background, normalize the image, and compute the contour and color characteristics of the wing pattern. In the recognition processes, the wing images will be classified into anterior or posterior wing automatically. Currently, 10 out of 16 species of giant silkworm moths in Taiwan are contained. Results show the accuracy will be more than 97% as both anterior and posterior wings images are provided.

Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors\u2019 names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters."}, {"paperId": "002743cc3ebfcfa1c5f0725721b5708c951849f2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002743cc3ebfcfa1c5f0725721b5708c951849f2", "title": "Design package for fuel retrieval system fuel handling tool modification", "year": 1999, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc718026/m2/1/high_res_d/781590.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "other-oa", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2172/781590?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2172/781590, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One method to infer this knowledge is through the use of cloze-style prompts.

In this paper, we study the impact of prompt syntax on the knowledge retrieval capacity of LLMs. We use a template-based approach to paraphrase simple prompts into prompts with a more complex grammatical structure. We then analyse the LLM performance for these structurally different but semantically equivalent prompts. Our study reveals that simple prompts work better than complex forms of sentences. The performance across the syntactical variations for simple relations (1:1) remains best, with a marginal decrease across different typologies. These results reinforce that simple prompt structures are more effective for knowledge retrieval in LLMs and motivate future research into the impact of prompt syntax on various tasks."}, {"paperId": "0029bbd8dce72272aa7e3df3a6cd752453eecf7a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0029bbd8dce72272aa7e3df3a6cd752453eecf7a", "title": "Video Content Encryption as a Service and Performance Implications of Video Data Encryption on Cloud", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.35940/ijitee.a5044.119119", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35940/ijitee.a5044.119119?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35940/ijitee.a5044.119119, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The cloud computing platform provides scalability for applications and data, which enables the application owners to deal with complex algorithms, which is needed for video content analysis and retrievals. The primary concern of the video data retrieval on cloud services are the weak security for the standard data during migrating from one VM to another VM. Also, the standard encryption algorithms have failed to demonstrate higher performance during encryption of a large file. Hence, the demand of the recent research is to ensure reduced performance implications for video content encryption over cloud services. This work proposes an adaptive encryption and decryption algorithm for large video data over cloud as Encryption as A Service (EAAS). This work proposes a novel key age calculation dependent on Quartic Polynomial Randomization. The quartic part utilized in the proposed calculation can produce numerous defining moments, which makes the calculation results hard to foresee and the utilization of polynomial randomization can further build the haphazardness of the defining moments. Likewise, the higher size of the video information must be diminished without rotting the data and without trading off the security. Subsequently, this work proposes a novel key edge comparability extraction procedure utilizing versatile movement. The similitude areas in the key casings contains comparable data and, in this manner, can be scrambled all around. This diminishes the time unpredictability to a more noteworthy broaden. Associated with the comparable line of advancement, this work likewise proposes time limited encryption and unscrambling calculations, which can separate between the comparable and unique areas and decrease the time intricacy further. The proposed algorithm demonstrates nearly 40% improvements over the standard encryption algorithms."}, {"paperId": "0029c1610985dfa9336c928230e5da3191ac9ff7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0029c1610985dfa9336c928230e5da3191ac9ff7", "title": "Identification of HCHO sources due to Isoprene or/and biomass burning emissions using combined HCHO and NO2 satellite observations", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51295619", "name": "T.

With the fast increase of load of the network, traditional host-centric based network paradigm (i.e., TCP/IP) faces great challenges in terms of efficiency, security, and privacy. To solve the problems confronting the current Internet, the Information-Centric Network (ICN) becomes a promising solution, where the focal point is identified content rather than specific host addresses. This paradigm brings many benefits, e.g., network traffic reduction, low retrieval latency. Besides, benefiting from the advance of programmable network hardware, the operator can reconfigure the network hardware\u2019 behavior, thus providing hardware support to describe the ICN instances. However, ICN also poses new challenges to cache management. The cache redundancy and unequal resource allocation will seriously affect the performance of the network. In this paper, we propose a distributed variational Bayes aided content popularity prediction algorithm. The extensive and indepth simulations are performed to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to the other state-of-the-art schemes."}, {"paperId": "002b11b42211f47969bf37d6119ef87c580b50df", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002b11b42211f47969bf37d6119ef87c580b50df", "title": "Pictorial Encoding Techniques for a Pictorial Database.", "year": 1983, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48473256", "name": "C.

To enhance user accessibility, we emphasize the interface\u2019s features including large text, white and black interface for vision support, voice interaction capabilities, and simplified navigation, catering to the varied technological proficiency levels within the community. The chatbot\u2019s functionalities are divided into two primary goals: facilitating information navigation within the retirement community and enhancing technology and eHealth literacy among its residents. For information navigation, the chatbot allows users to easily access essential information such as dining menus and contact details. To improve technology literacy, the chatbot delivers simple, up-to-date guides and information on specific questions posed by the users, providing them with easy-to-follow instructions. To evaluate our chatbot, residents were asked to complete tasks during the trial session and complete a survey. The survey collected demographics, digital literacy scores, user satisfaction, and feasibility. Residents successfully utilized our chatbot to complete the tasks. Furthermore, they reported high levels of satisfaction and a strong likelihood of recommending it to peers. Therefore, we suggest that our chatbot may serve as a valuable tool for older adults with low technology and eHealth literacy."}, {"paperId": "002e39f6fd78d2b4c4a0c28d9461b9daa31865bb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002e39f6fd78d2b4c4a0c28d9461b9daa31865bb", "title": "GenEdit: Compounding Operators and Continuous Improvement to Tackle Text-to-SQL in the Enterprise", "year": 2025, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21602, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments remain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge, handle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To address these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL generation system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and maintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators decomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to improve future SQL generations. We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed SQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For generation, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge retrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides generation. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval stage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or sub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the retrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in natural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to generate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex SQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic and semantic errors.

Typical data include textual catalogue cards manageable through an information retrieval system (IRS), as well as textual captions, images, video, and speech, organizable as a hypermedia network. In this paper we propose a model for the design of these applications, and discuss its effectiveness in improving the quality of the application. The model exploits a multi-level design approach to organize data and access structures of the IRS, while the Entity-Relationship (E-R) approach, tailored to model hypermedia applications, is adopted to describe the structure of the documents and their links."}, {"paperId": "00329fb440588d271f679f628a3c158a3eb6fb44", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00329fb440588d271f679f628a3c158a3eb6fb44", "title": "[Scientific medical information--search and retrieval].", "year": 1988, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5102500", "name": "K.

In general, to determine of the effectiveness of IR application is determined by two factors, namely recall and precision [7,8,10]. According to Jarvelin and Ingwersen, the effectiveness of IR application is not only determined by the recall and precision, but rather the ability of IR applications in helping users to complete the search more effective and efficient. The effectiveness of an IR application is determined by recall, precision, time requirements, and reporting documents are presented to the user [7]. To improve the performance of IR applications in time requirements is implemented multithreading in the preprocessing process, i.e. stage 1 to stage 4 GVSM method.

In this paper we address two issues such as retrieval and recognition. We present a novel method called Triplet-CBMIR for lung nodules CT images retrieval and recognition application. A Triplet CBMIR is a combination of three properties: Visual Features (Shape and Texture), Semantic Features and Relevance Feedback. Dataset training is done using: Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Selection, Nodules Sign Detection and Clustering. In preprocessing we perform image scaling, denoising and normalization. In feature extraction, two methods are presented such as Hybrid Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Bounding-Box based Convolutional Network (CNN) for visual and semantic features extraction. Then optimum set of feature vectors are selected using Mutual Information based Neighborhood Entropy (MIN\u03b5). Based on selected features, lung nodule sign is detected using K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm in which Hassanat Distance used and similar images are grouped using Multi-Self organizing Map (SOM). For similarity measurement, d_1 distance metric is used. Benchmark dataset such as LISS and LIDC are used for the study. Performance matrices such as Average Precision Rate (APR), Average Retrieval Rate (ARR), Average Recognition Rate (ArR), Running Time found in the simulation results are compared with some other already present state-of-the-art works. The proposed method shows a significant improvement as compared to other existing methods."}, {"paperId": "0036527c64872f3b145cff972ae184a7e3b8823f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0036527c64872f3b145cff972ae184a7e3b8823f", "title": "Information Science Abstracts: an overview of history, purpose and goals.

Our approach takes the method beyond the hitherto achieved imaging of simple diatomic molecules and is based on the combination of a 160\u2009kHz mid-infrared few-cycle laser source with full three-dimensional electron\u2013ion coincidence detection. Our technique provides an accessible and robust route towards imaging ultrafast processes in complex gas-phase molecules with atto- to femto-second temporal resolution.

In this paper we propose a complete set of multi-layered technologies to handle at least some of the above issues: (1) Automatic Generation of Titles and Sum-maries for each of the spoken documents, such that the spoken documents become much more easier to browse, (2) Global Semantic Structuring of the entire spoken document archive, offering to the user a global picture of the semantic structure of the archive, and (3) Query-based Local Semantic Structuring for the subset of the spoken documents retrieved by the user\u2019s query, providing the user the detailed semantic structure of the relevant spoken documents given the query he entered. The Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is found to be helpful, and an initial prototype system for the functions mentioned above has been successfully developed, in which the broadcast news archive in Mandarin Chinese is taken as the example archive."}, {"paperId": "003e2b9e7331d447cb8e6a431044559c57735dba", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e2b9e7331d447cb8e6a431044559c57735dba", "title": "Feature Extraction and Content Based Image Retrieval for High Resolution Remote Sensing Images", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.35940/ijrte.c6677.098319", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35940/ijrte.c6677.098319?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35940/ijrte.c6677.098319, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It delivers great advantages over traditional single-spectral ReID in complex visual environment. However, the significant distribution gap among different image spectra poses great challenges for effective multi-spectral feature representations. In addition, most of current Transformer-based ReID methods only utilize the global feature of class tokens to achieve the holistic retrieval, ignoring the local discriminative ones. To address the above issues, we step further to utilize all the tokens of Transformers and propose a cyclic token permutation framework for multi-spectral object ReID, dubbled TOP-ReID. More specifically, we first deploy a multi-stream deep network based on vision Transformers to preserve distinct information from different image spectra. Then, we propose a Token Permutation Module (TPM) for cyclic multi-spectral feature aggregation. It not only facilitates the spatial feature alignment across different image spectra, but also allows the class token of each spectrum to perceive the local details of other spectra. Meanwhile, we propose a Complementary Reconstruction Module (CRM), which introduces dense token-level reconstruction constraints to reduce the distribution gap across different image spectra. With the above modules, our proposed framework can generate more discriminative multi-spectral features for robust object ReID. Extensive experiments on three ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100 and MSVR310) verify the effectiveness of our methods.

This dissertation studies the idea of example-driven question answering, which focuses on learning to search, select, and generate answers to unseen questions solely by observing existing noisy question-answer examples along with text corpus or knowledge base. To achieve this goal, we developed novel neural network architectures throughout the QA pipeline, that can be trained directly from question-answer examples. First, we propose candidate retrieval models that can utilize noisy signals to produce dense indexing for text corpus and generate structured queries for knowledge graphs. Second, we developed generative relevance models that do not require annotated negative QA pairs and discriminative relevance models that can utilize pseudo negative examples. Third, we improved encoderdecoder models for response text generation which can accept external guidance for specific language style and topic. The integrated QA pipeline aims to generate answer-like embedding vectors to search, select the most relevant passages, and compose a natural-sounding response based on the selected passages. This dissertation demonstrates the feasibility of creating open-domain example-driven QA pipelines based on neural networks without any feature engineering or dedicated manual annotations for each QA module. Experiments show our models achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on several real-world ranking and generation tasks on domains of QA and conversation generation. When applying in the TREC LiveQA competitions, our approach received the highest average scores among automatic systems in main tasks of 2015, 2016 and 2017, and the highest average score in the medical subtask of 2017."}, {"paperId": "0047a6037303cb8507506c260a79bec99d280f21", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0047a6037303cb8507506c260a79bec99d280f21", "title": "A survey of ontology learning techniques and applications", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/database/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/database/bay101/27329264/bay101.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6173224, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Ontologies are often considered a fine source of semantics and interoperability in all artificially smart systems. Exponential increase in unstructured data on the web has made automated acquisition of ontology from unstructured text a most prominent research area. Several methodologies exploiting numerous techniques of various fields (machine learning, text mining, knowledge representation and reasoning, information retrieval and natural language processing) are being proposed to bring some level of automation in the process of ontology acquisition from unstructured text. This paper describes the process of ontology learning and further classification of ontology learning techniques into three classes (linguistics, statistical and logical) and discusses many algorithms under each category. This paper also explores ontology evaluation techniques by highlighting their pros and cons. Moreover, it describes the scope and use of ontology learning in several industries.

McElligott"}], "abstract": "Ambulance-based telemedicine can permit stroke consultations en-route to the hospital which can decrease treatment times (Rogers et al., 2017). In these consultations a team of caregivers treat the patient using a telemedicine system; primarily the neurologist, the nurse at the receiving hospital and the paramedic in the back of the ambulance. In stroke care the life-saving treatment called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the gold standard for ischemic stroke. The potential for critical errors in using tPA is high with many conditions for its use, such as time restrictions and medication (Fugate & Rabinstein, 2015, Powers et al., 2018); while telemedicine provides access to specialists with the best training to assess these patients, the complex tasks and the interactions between team members in a stroke assessment make this process at risk for many human errors. Based on the use of the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) in healthcare (Kermani et al., 2016; Khandan et al., 2017), and the support of SHERPA as a human error identification technique as compared to other common tools (Salmon et al., 2002), SHERPA was used to understand how the use of telemedicine for stroke assessment creates human error and how those errors can be reduced or eliminated through the use of system design. From simple observations and questioning during a simulated stroke, a HTA was performed from the time a caregiver logged on to the telemedicine system to the patient leaving the ambulance after completing a stroke assessment. This HTA was used as the input to the SHERPA, then all bottom level tasks were classified according to a behavior taxonomy developed by Stanton (2006) as either Action, Retrieval, Checking, Selection, or Information Communication tasks and further error types and descriptions of errors were developed for each task. The consequences, probability, criticality, and possibility of recovery of the error were identified based on the observations and interactions with the caregivers. Finally, for each error at least one remediation was identified. A total of 97 tasks were documented in the HTA. At least one error was found for each task, 151 were documented overall. Primarily errors were classified as Information Communication as most data needed for stroke assessment is collected from the paramedic and patient verbally. As such, the most common error is miscommunication or not hearing the response to a communicated command. There are also many Action Errors for tasks involving recording vitals and creating the patient case. Error remediations created 3 main categories, interface formatting, automation and audio improvements, and training. Given the large amount of data entered into this system, the data required to be entered should be highlighted in some way. Further, for data input such as dates and times, rigid formatting is a way to eliminate confusion and maintain consistency in data input. Suggested formatting could be used for data such as patient blood pressure, heart rate, or blood oxygenation by providing an example of a common data input with the correct units. For tasks that require manipulation of controls, such as the camera focused on the patient, a simple command or control would automatically focus the camera on an area of the patient rather than requiring the neurologist to manually control the camera. This could eliminate over or under correction the camera location and reduce the instance that an assessment item is incorrectly recorded due to lack of detailed visibility. Closed captioning of the audio or improvements to the speakers and microphones in the system could also improve the communication between caregivers. Consistency in procedure steps and increased familiarity with the assessment steps are the training remediations suggested in this analysis. Specifically with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a lengthy standard assessment for stroke, errors in communication could be reduced with training for paramedics in assessment tasks and the order in which to expect those assessment tasks will reduce the instances of repeated communication from the neurologist and reduce probability of miscommunication.

Historically, IR relied on textual overlaps for relevant context retrieval, employing methods like BM25 and TF-IDF, which, however, lacked natural language understanding. The advent of deep learning ushered in a new era, leading to the introduction of Dense Passage Retrievers (DPR), shows superiority over traditional sparse retrievers. These dense retrievers leverage Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs) to initialize context encoders, enabling the extraction of natural language representations. They utilize the distance between latent vectors of contexts as a metric for assessing similarity. However, DPR methods are heavily reliant on large volumes of meticulously labeled data, such as Natural Questions. The process of data labeling is both costly and time-intensive. In this article, we propose a novel data augmentation methodology Self Data Augmentation (SDA) that employs DPR models to automatically annotate unanswered questions. Specifically, we initiate the process by retrieving relevant pseudo passages for these unlabeled questions. We subsequently introduce three distinct passage selection methods to annotate these pseudo passages. Ultimately, we amalgamate the pseudo-labeled passages with the unanswered questions to create augmented data. Our experimental evaluations conducted on two extensive datasets (Natural Questions and TriviaQA), alongside a relatively small dataset (WebQuestions), utilizing three diverse base models, illustrate the significant enhancement achieved through the incorporation of freshly augmented data. Moreover, our proposed data augmentation method exhibits remarkable flexibility, which is readily adaptable to various dense retrievers. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive human study on the augmented data, which further supports our conclusions."}, {"paperId": "004f57e34ef0403f182ac6ea4181b14a10d4533b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004f57e34ef0403f182ac6ea4181b14a10d4533b", "title": "Analysis of the match probabilities for the iTrust information network with message forwarding", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

From the user\u2019s point of view, the same hand-drawn image may represent many different things, due to the semantic \u201cone-to-many\u201d category mapping relationship between the hand-drawn image and the natural image, that is the inherent ambiguity of hand-drawn image. In addition, the user\u2019s drawing has many different characteristics, so the retrieval results generally cannot fully match with his intent. For the above-mentioned challenges, a personalized SBIR architecture is proposed, including a deep full convolutional neural network as a general model and a personalized model using transfer learning to achieve fine-grained image semantic feature. On the basis of the pre-trained general model and the images selected by the user in history, we construct the personalized model training dataset. Moreover, the user history feedback with the current hand-drawn image is combined as the input of the transfer learning model, to fine-tune the distribution of features in vector space, so that the neural network can learn the personalized semantic information. The experiments show that the general model has strong generalization ability with the mean average precision as 0.64 on the Flickr15 K dataset. The migration model can realize fine-grained image semantic vector space division, which perfectly satisfies the personalized retrieval requirements by hand-drawn sketch-based image input."}, {"paperId": "004fed33bc954457cad436a617e978a59825c078", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004fed33bc954457cad436a617e978a59825c078", "title": "Mapping the paradigm of information science based on cluster analysis of citation data", "year": 1995, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2008088", "name": "S.

An investigation was carried out regarding the question whether systematic arrangement by means of a classification scheme can offer a solution for the problems of information organisation on the Internet. The purpose of the investigation was to establish the extent of present use of classification on the Internet, which systems are being used, what the nature, characteristics and applications of these schemes are and to formulate broad guidelines for classification in this electronic environment. The classification schemes and other retrieval mechanisms of a variety of Internet guides and search engines were analysed. Two groups of schemes were identified: library classifications with notations and other schemes consisting in most cases of alphabetically arranged subject classes. Classification schemes are used for two purposes in guides: the arrangement of entries and in a few cases to provide access points for specific searches. Facilities for keyword searching are provided in the majority of guides, but descriptors from controlled indexing languages are used in very few cases. Ondersoek is ingestel na die vraag of die gebruik van sistematiese rangskikking met behulp van 'n klassitikasiesisteem nie 'n oplossing kan bied vir die probleme van inligtingontsluiting op die Internet nie. Die doel van die ondersoek was om te bepaal wat die omvang van die huidige gebruik van klassifikasie op die Internet is, watter sisteme gebruik word, wat die aard, kenmerke en toepassings van hierdie sisteme is en om bree riglyne vir klassifikasie in hierdie elektroniese omgewing te formuleer. Die klassifikasiesisteme en ander ontsluitingsmeganismes van 'n verskeidenheid van Internetgidse en soekenjins is ontleed. Twee groepe sisteme kan onderskei word: biblioteekklassifikasiesisteme wat oor 'n notasie beskik en ander sisteme wat meestal uit alfabetiesgerangskikte onderwerpsklasse bestaan. Klassifikasiesisteme word vir twee doeleindes in gidse gebruik: die rangskikking van inskrywings en in enkele gevalle om toegangspunte vir spesifieke soektogte te verskaf.

Opinion mining, or sentiment analysis, is a subfield of natural language processing that develops systems for identifying and extracting ideas from text. Sentiment analysis is a hot topic since it has many practical applications. Many opinion-expressing texts are available on review sites, forums, blogs, and social media as the amount of publicly available information on the Internet grows. This unstructured information can then be automatically transformed into structured data about products, services, brands, politics, or other topics on which people can express their opinions using sentiment analysis systems. This information can be used for marketing analytics, public relations, product reviews, network sponsor ratings, product feedback, and customer service. With the rapid growth of labeled sample data sets and the notable enhancement in graphics processor (GPU) performance, convolutional neural network research has advanced rapidly and achieved remarkable leads to various computer vision tasks.

Users expect video search engines to be useful as an instrument that facilitates communication, education, entertainment and problem solving and, in relation to this, to satisfy diverse information needs. A user's information need is the lack that a user is attempting to overcome by engaging in information seeking behavior and can be seen as having two important dimensions: it comprises both a 'what' dimension reflecting the topic of the search and a 'why' dimension corresponding to the user intent, the immediate reason, purpose or goal behind the information need. Video search engines are relatively successful at returning search results that users find to be on topic. These results do not, however, completely satisfy the users' information needs unless they also fulfill the users' intents. The purpose of this thesis is to enable the intent-related focus shift in the design and realization of video search engines and to advance them in terms of user intent in order to satisfy users' information needs to their full extent. This advancement is challenging because it affects the entire pipeline of the video search engine: video indexing, query processing, and search results ranking. However, it also has the potential to substantially improve the overall utility of video search engines and increase the impact, significance and economic value of the online video content. We start to tackle this challenge by analyzing a real-world transaction log produced by a state-of-the-art video search engine with the objective to obtain a deeper understanding why queries submitted by users in their search sessions fail. Based on the results of this analysis, we build classifiers to automatically predict these reasons for query failure given a set of multimodal features derived from both the user interactions with the search engine as well as the search results produced by the engine. Our analysis of the transaction log reveals several distinct reasons for why user queries in video search fail. Among others, one of the reasons is the way user goals are expressed in the query, i.e., a single query can correspond to different underlying goals. In other words, intent is often not explicitly reflected in the query. This fact motivates us to tackle this challenge and to investigate the usefulness of incorporating user intent in video search engines. As a first step, we investigate the nature of the immediate reason, purpose or goal behind a user information need that constitutes intent. We carry out a social-Web mining approach combined with crowdsourcing and a manual coding process in order to derive a conceptual model (i.e., a typology constituting search intent categories) covering different reasons why users consult video search engines. This typology builds the basis for integrating user intent in video search engines. We then provide evidence that users differentiate videos in search engine results lists on the basis of these user intent categories. In addition to understanding which search intents exist in video search, it is equally important to understand which intents are associated with videos. This understanding is crucial, as it builds the foundation of matching the search intents expressed by users in search scenarios to the intents that are associated with videos stored in the video search engine's index. While in search scenarios intent can be characterized by the different reasons why users consult a video search engine, comparable user actions can be investigated for why videos were added to the search engine's index in the first place. For this reason, we investigate the user action of uploading videos to the Internet and apply a combination of social-Web mining and crowdsourcing to arrive at a conceptual model (i.e., a typology constituting uploader intent categories) that characterizes the various reasons why users upload videos to the Internet. We then build algorithms that automatically classify videos into these categories. Finally, we demonstrate that uploader intent categories correlate with search intent categories, which provides the opportunity for incorporating intent into the retrieval functions of video search engines. With search intent categories and uploader intent categories and their automatic prediction at hand, we face the challenging task of introducing user intent in search results rankings that produce video search results lists that optimally reflect user intent. We propose an intent-aware video search result optimization approach that exploits the structure of topically-relevant initial results lists produced by the search engine in response to user-submitted queries in order to predict which search intent/s the user would most likely wish to satisfy. Based on this information, the approach optimizes the initial lists in a way that search results with the highest potential to satisfy the users' search intent/s are positioned at the very top of the list without decreasing its topical focus. Finally, although this thesis contributes a substantial amount of research towards user intent-aware video search engines, we believe that additional challenges will emerge in the future that will go above and beyond the challenges addressed in this thesis. We identify and discuss these challenges and expect them to attract significant research efforts that will lead to productive outcomes in the field of user intent-aware video search engines in the following years."}, {"paperId": "00585e0c6c123493cf6b2ab6d77a15073807eb5b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00585e0c6c123493cf6b2ab6d77a15073807eb5b", "title": "Analysis of International Competitiveness of Multinational Corporations Based on Rough Sets", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2021/9922410.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2021/9922410?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9922410, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Therefore, the theory of rough set is helpful for decision-makers to solve the decision problems of complex systems. The simplification of knowledge of information systems and incomplete information systems and the theoretical and methodological study of rule acquisition are the central issues of rough set theory and applied research. A variety of simplified theories and methods have been proposed from a variety of viewpoints.

There are a variety of data to measure these factors, which are mutually restrictive and interdependent. At present, domestic and foreign scholars have basically formed a series of assessment methods and models of investment environment assessment, but most of these assessment methods are affected by the differences in the degree of subjective factors of evaluators and the establishment of index weights in the assessment process. In most cases, more reliance is placed on subjective, artificial assignments and scoring loops. Therefore, it is an appropriate and reasonable method to evaluate the investment environment through data to evaluate all the factors affecting the investment environment and reach a comprehensive evaluation conclusion, which can effectively avoid human subjective factors to a certain extent."}, {"paperId": "005a72a7edbda0ea51f85a0c8e55dd714b068e04", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005a72a7edbda0ea51f85a0c8e55dd714b068e04", "title": "Zero-error communication under discrete-time Markovian dynamics", "year": 2024, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18703, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics `scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics."}, {"paperId": "005aad5663a4c502e62cd4bc56948b910cb60992", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005aad5663a4c502e62cd4bc56948b910cb60992", "title": "Utterance-to-Utterance Interactive Matching Network for Multi-Turn Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06940", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06940, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Different from previous methods following context-to-response matching or utterance-to-response matching frameworks, this model treats both contexts and responses as sequences of utterances when calculating the matching degrees between them. For a context-response pair, the U2U-IMN model first encodes each utterance separately using recurrent and self-attention layers. Then, a global and bidirectional interaction between the context and the response is conducted using the attention mechanism to collect the matching information between them. The distances between context and response utterances are employed as a prior component when calculating the attention weights. Finally, sentence-level aggregation and context-response-level aggregation are executed in turn to obtain the feature vector for matching degree prediction. Experiments on four public datasets showed that our proposed method outperformed baseline methods on all metrics, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating compatibility across domains for multi-turn response selection."}, {"paperId": "005ac3b7d37f19b7192284f8d4765985deb51a94", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005ac3b7d37f19b7192284f8d4765985deb51a94", "title": "HPL ALGORITHM FOR SEMANTIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL WITH RDFAND SPARQL", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9311011", "name": "Prathyusha Kanakam"}, {"authorId": "35753614", "name": "S.

S3LLM leverages open-source LLaMA-2 models to enhance code analysis through the automatic transformation of natural language queries into domain-specific language (DSL) queries. Specifically, it translates these queries into Feature Query Language (FQL), enabling efficient scanning and parsing of entire code repositories. In addition, S3LLM is equipped to handle diverse metadata types, including DOT, SQL, and customized formats. Furthermore, S3LLM incorporates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and LangChain technologies to directly query extensive documents. S3LLM demonstrates the potential of using locally deployed open-source LLMs for the rapid understanding of large-scale scientific computing software, eliminating the need for extensive coding expertise, and thereby making the process more efficient and effective.

First, the spatial characteristics of the multibeam swath data are integrated into the traditional quadtree structure, resulting in an oriented quadtree for data organization. Then, the primary orientation of the root node\u2019s bounding box, which reflects the main orientation of the swath, is consistently applied to all child nodes, eliminating the need to calculate the orientation for each individual child node by the conventional oriented quadtree. Finally, index files containing the point cloud offset, oriented bounding box, and child node information for root, child, and leaf nodes are designed and stored in external storage. Experimental results indicate that, in terms of tree construction time, although the traditional quadtree reduces time consumption by approximately 50% compared to the improved oriented quadtree, the improved oriented quadtree still achieves a 70% reduction in time consumption compared to the conventional oriented quadtree. Regarding point cloud retrieval, within the same retrieval range, the improved oriented quadtree achieves similar average retrieval times as the conventional oriented quadtree but reduces the maximum time consumption by approximately 20.83% compared to the traditional quadtree. Furthermore, by storing the constructed index in binary format on external storage, the space occupancy was reduced by 50%. The approach effectively organizes acoustic multibeam bathymetric point clouds, providing valuable insights for enhancing point cloud retrieval efficiency and reducing data memory usage."}, {"paperId": "00621791506a8d3b83d6ba8c8f6aac2d389d0707", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00621791506a8d3b83d6ba8c8f6aac2d389d0707", "title": "On Fuzzy Information Retrieval", "year": 1991, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3156/jfuzzy.3.1_15", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3156/JFUZZY.3.1_15?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3156/JFUZZY.3.1_15, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, retrieving relevant content during decision-making remains time-consuming due to the scale and complexity of the material. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question Answering (QA) systems offer a promising solution, building an internal RAG-QA system poses several challenges: (1) handling heterogeneous multi-modal data sources, (2) preserving data confidentiality, and (3) enabling traceability between each piece of information in the generated answer and its original source document. To address these, we propose a RAG-QA framework for internal enterprise use, consisting of: (1) a data pipeline that converts raw multi-modal documents into a structured corpus and QA pairs, (2) a fully on-premise, privacy-preserving architecture, and (3) a lightweight reference matcher that links answer segments to supporting content. Applied to the automotive domain, our system improves factual correctness (+1.79, +1.94), informativeness (+1.33, +1.16), and helpfulness (+1.08, +1.67) over a non-RAG baseline, based on 1-5 scale ratings from both human and LLM judge."}, {"paperId": "0063074db60a69314278b9689e3f3787c7319fdb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0063074db60a69314278b9689e3f3787c7319fdb", "title": "Manipulating the reported age in earliest memories", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2017.1396345?needAccess=true", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/09658211.2017.1396345?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2017.1396345, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Memory, 21(2), 280\u2013284. doi:10.1080/09658211.2012.729598] and that the age in decontextualised snippets of memory is younger than in more complete accounts (i.e., event memories [Bruce, D., Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn, L. A., Robinson, J. A., Phillips-Grant, K., Francis, L., & Smith, M. C. (2005). Fragment memories mark the end of childhood amnesia. Memory & Cognition, 33(4), 567\u2013576. doi:10.3758/BF03195324]). We examined the malleability of the estimated age in undergraduates\u2019 earliest memories and its relation with memory quality. In Study 1 (n\u2009=\u2009141), vignettes referring to events happening at age 2 rendered earlier reported ages than examples referring to age 6. Exploratory analyses suggested that event memories were more sensitive to the age manipulation than memories representing a single, isolated scene (i.e., snapshots). In Study 2 (n\u2009=\u2009162), asking self-relevant and public-event knowledge questions about participants\u2019 preschool years prior to retrieval yielded comparable average estimated ages. Both types of semantic knowledge questions rendered earlier memories than a no-age control task. Overall, the reported age in snapshots was younger than in event memories. However, age-differences between memory types across conditions were not statistically significant. Together, the results add to the growing literature indicating that the average age in earliest memories is not as fixed as previously thought."}, {"paperId": "00634b986b13c5e359d48bd34c8301bcca8fb95f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00634b986b13c5e359d48bd34c8301bcca8fb95f", "title": "Web Pages Information Retrieval Based on Keywords Cluster and Node Instance", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064573028", "name": "Deng Jian"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0063e18e9272b89014526fc3725dc24bc08630b8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0063e18e9272b89014526fc3725dc24bc08630b8", "title": "Spectroscopic measurements of halocarbons and hydrohalocarbons by satellite\u2010borne remote sensors", "year": 2003, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1029/2002JD002649?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD002649, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The reliability of the existing spectroscopic parameters has been examined, and it was found that only laboratory parameters measured at high resolution reproduce the satellite observations well. It is shown that solar occultation spectra can give information regarding the atmospheric abundance of CFC-113, in addition to the usual retrievals of CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22. Also, relying on existing emission scenarios, it is foreseen that future solar occultation experiments, such as the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), will be able to detect HCFC-142b and HFC-134a, from the year 2005 onward and at low tangent heights. As for the nadir-looking missions, it is found that CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22 can be retrieved from IMG spectra, provided that numerous measurements are averaged over space or time, thereby mitigating the usefulness of such measurements for determining surface sources. The improved geometrical scanning performances of the future nadir-looking Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), however, are shown to be more promising in this respect."}, {"paperId": "0063e296aed60219e4ebc3239419a0cff71ec9ff", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0063e296aed60219e4ebc3239419a0cff71ec9ff", "title": "George Lodge and Craig Wilson: a Corporate Solution to Global Poverty Globalization: Definition and Data", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108913901", "name": "Craig Wilson"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "006560e4204bb5d993053390389b297364e28cda", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006560e4204bb5d993053390389b297364e28cda", "title": "Spatial and Temporal Information Retrieval in Textual Corpora", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/9781118790113.ch2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118790113.ch2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Clinical note authors too commonly adopt their own note-taking structures and styles, limiting the applicability of rule-based and statistical models. While the context of any given sentence within a note carries important implied information, context is notoriously difficult for a language model to infer. However, recent advances in deep learning NLP methods such as pre-training on domain-specific corpora, novel embedding structures, and transformer architectures have enabled an awareness of context not previously attainable. In this work, I study the application of these evidenced NLP approaches to a gold standard annotated corpus of primary care notes of multiple Mayo Clinic EHR systems. The strongly labelled data will be supplemented with large volumes of weakly labelled data curated using distant supervision. The combined dataset will be used to train and evaluate context classification and section boundary detection models that classify the current context of a sentence given adjacent text segments. Once validated against primary care corpora, transfer learning methods will enable access to shared knowledge across more specific clinical domains, enabling generalizability across clinical domains and a degree of transparency into the shared aspects of the integrated model."}, {"paperId": "0067aea2f3b90bb869bec1a22627b9d3ed01f62f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0067aea2f3b90bb869bec1a22627b9d3ed01f62f", "title": "Evaluation procedure of a module-based approach for undergraduate information retrieval education", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

For identity-congruent brands related to a current (future) self-identity, consumers elaborate on and process more concrete (abstract) brand information, resulting in stronger brand associations that are more easily recalled from memory. Study 2 leverages this effect to enhance the recall of brand knowledge by matching the psychological distance of a self-identity with a construal mindset. Study 3 demonstrates that retrieval of newly learned brand information can be enhanced by matching the psychological distance of a self-identity with the concreteness of advertising messaging and identifies consumers for whom this effect may not occur (i.e., those with high product involvement).

In 2020, CLEF eHealth is calling for participants to contribute to the following two tasks: The 2020 Task 1 on IE focuses on term coding for clinical textual data in Spanish. The terms considered are extracted from clinical case records and they are mapped onto the Spanish version of the International Classification of Diseases, the 10th Revision, including also textual evidence spans for the clinical codes. The 2020 Task 2 is a novel extension of the most popular and established task in CLEF eHealth on CHS. This IR task uses the representative web corpus used in the 2018 challenge, but now also spoken queries, as well as textual transcripts of these queries, are offered to the participants. The task is structured into a number of optional subtasks, covering ad-hoc search using the spoken queries, textual transcripts of the spoken queries, or provided automatic speech-to-text conversions of the spoken queries. In this paper we describe the evolution of CLEF eHealth and this year\u2019s tasks.

Lander"}], "abstract": "There are many quirky findings in memory research. Often ignored as being trivialities, Memory Quirks: The Study of Odd Phenomena in Memory instead champions the study of these oddities, highlighting how they challenge our understanding of memory. This book brings together a collection of short chapters, which focus on wide-ranging topics, such as blocked and recovered memories, insight and creativity, memory context and cueing, tip-of-thetongue states, and implicit memory. Different expert researchers, who draw on examples from their own experiences and research, write each chapter. The impetus for writing this book was the retirement of Professor Alan Brown from Southern Methodist University (USA). A lifelong advocate of the study of memory quirks, this book was born out of discussions at his retirement gathering and was further formulated at a later conference. The cohesion of the book as a whole is reflected in the book\u2019s narrative, with logical progression and overlaps between chapters. Overall, the book serves as a tribute to the legacy of a valued colleague (who himself contributed two chapters) and as a useful text of interest to both students and researchers alike. Three broad sections are outlined in the book with autobiographic memory considered in Chapters 1 to 5. Autobiographical memory is our memory of personal events and self, guiding our behaviour and interactions throughout life. In this sense, autobiographical memory is not really a \u201cquirk\u201d per se but rather some of the findings within this literature are presented as being inherently \u201cquirky.\u201d Chapter 1 (Brown and colleagues) considers how our own autobiographical memories can be altered by information from others. Specifically, how we may borrow stories from other people and actively add to, change, or eliminate parts of our personal past. Chapter 2 (Costic and Cunningham) carefully considers how the quantity and quality of our autobiographical memories change throughout our lives. Why don\u2019t we remember much from being a young child (childhood amnesia)? This chapter outlines how our memory for personal events changes over our lifetime\u2014from the reminiscence bump to nostalgia and the feeling that life is speeding up as you get older. The reminiscence bump is a tendency for older adults (over 40 years) to have a disproportionally increased or enhanced recollection for personal events from adolescence and early adulthood (up to about 25 years old). This topic is one that is fascinating but somewhat neglected. I remember, many years ago, keenly running a reminiscence bump recall experiment looking at autobiographical memories and I am left wondering how far we have moved on in our understanding of this effect since then. Explanations of the reminiscence bump typically include biological/maturational theories (e.g., the timing of the reminiscence bump reflects when people have the greatest potential to reproduce), narrative/self-identity theories (e.g., the timing reflects a critical period for the formation of self-identity), as well as cognitive theories (e.g., the timing reflects a memory advantage for novel and distinctive events). An interesting finding here is that the reminiscence bump obtained in response to odours is earlier than that found using cue words, which is itself earlier and smaller with that obtained when important memories are requested. These differences in the size and location of the reminiscence bump support theories based primarily on memory retrieval rather than encoding and retention. Indeed, the fact that changing the retrieval cue alters the memories accessed emphasises the flexibility of the memories retrieved. Chapter 3 (Marsh and Yang) asks whether memories of events that you did not personally experience can play a similar role as actual memories from your own life. Memories from fictional events, such as from books, TV shows, and films, may sometimes serve the same function as autobiographical events we have personally experienced. All \u201cautobiographical\u201d events, whether experienced or fictional, may act as flexible constructions or reconstructions of these events. However, important questions remain about the function of these memories based on fiction and their differences to experienced autobiographical events. How do they differ in terms of vividness and significance? How are fictional events interwoven and nested into our memories for real events? Many questions remain to be explored.

A stable and efficient numerical implementation of Phillips-Tikhonov regularization techniques is discussed; generalized singular value decomposition is the appropriate tool to compute the formal solution of the modified minimization problem, and the L-curve permits determination of the optimum balance between information from measurement and side constraints. It is also shown that these techniques can provide further insight in the basic ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, give tools for the diagnostics of the retrieved profiles, and allow a discussion of the relation to other standard retrieval techniques, especially optimal estimation. The methods are demonstrated on examples for retrieval of ozone and hydroxyl profiles from simulated far infrared high-resolution spectra.

The Wheat Trait and Phenotype ontology was created to annotate information on wheat traits from the literature (i.e. text found in the abstract, results and discussion of scholarly articles). To enable seamless data retrieval on wheat traits from these complementary sources, the classes in the two ontologies have been aligned. Methods All pairs of ontology classes were examined and categorized in nine groups based on the nature of their relationships (e.g. equivalence, subsumption). General principles emerged from this process which were formalized into rules. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) representation was chosen to represent the mappings in RDF (Resource Description Framework), including their metadata such as creators, reviewers, and justification (including rules). Results The mapping dataset is publicly available. It covers 77% of the ontology classes. Most labels of the aligned classes differed significantly and required domain expertise for decisions, especially for traits related to biotic stress. Consequently, most mappings are close mappings rather than exact equivalents. Conclusions We present the end-to-end manual process used to select and represent mappings in SSSOM within the specific domain of wheat traits. We derive general lessons from the complex alignment process that extend beyond the specific case of these two ontologies and more generally apply to alignments of specialized ontologies for information retrieval purposes. This work demonstrates the relevance of SSSOM for representing these mappings."}, {"paperId": "0075c64f8355f7a798bca6681b848aaed4f3693e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0075c64f8355f7a798bca6681b848aaed4f3693e", "title": "Database and Retrieval-Display System of Atomic Data for Fusion", "year": 1981, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

These sensory modulation deficits would ultimately lead them to difficulties in adaptive behavior and intellectual functioning. The purpose of this study was to observe changes in the nervous system with responses to auditory/visual and only audio stimuli in children with autism and typically developing (TD) through electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, 20 children with ASD and 20 children with TD were considered to investigate the difference in the neural dynamics. The neural dynamics could be understood by non-linear analysis of the EEG signal. In this research to reveal the underlying nonlinear EEG dynamics, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is applied. RQA measures were analyzed using various parameter changes in RQA computations. In this research, the cosine distance metric was considered due to its capability of information retrieval and the other distance metrics parameters are compared for identifying the best biomarker. Each computational combination of the RQA measure and the responding channel was analyzed and discussed. To classify ASD and TD, the resulting features from RQA were fed to the designed BiLSTM (bi-long short-term memory) network. The classification accuracy was tested channel-wise for each combination. T3 and T5 channels with neighborhood selection as FAN (fixed amount of nearest neighbors) and distance metric as cosine is considered as the best-suited combination to discriminate between ASD and TD with the classification accuracy of 91.86%, respectively."}, {"paperId": "0076d3f933379d34e0f9fbdfe8022c5eb2d056e6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0076d3f933379d34e0f9fbdfe8022c5eb2d056e6", "title": "Interpreting and semantically describing Chinese traditional brocade: Xilankapu", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/EL-09-2018-0193?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/EL-09-2018-0193, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To further describe the images of this type of brocade, this paper presents semantic descriptions that include objective\u2013non-objective relations and a multi-layered semantic framework. Furthermore, the authors developed corresponding methods for scanning, storage and indexing images for retrieval.\n\n\nFindings\nAs exploratory research on describing, preserving and indexing images of Xilankapu in the context of the preservation of cultural heritage, the authors collected 1,000+ images of traditional Xilankapu, classifying and storing some of the images in a database. They developed an index schema that combines concept- and content-based approaches according to the proposed semantic description framework. They found that the framework can describe, store and preserve semantic and non-semantic information of the same image. They relate the findings of this paper to future research directions for the digital preservation of traditional cultural heritages.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe framework has been designed especially for brocade, and it needs to be extended to other types of cultural image.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe semantic description framework can describe connotative semantic information on Xilankapu. It can also assist the later information retrieval work in organizing implicit information about culturally related visual materials.\n"}, {"paperId": "00775b89200e27fa81072aa03bc01b521a45d1dd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00775b89200e27fa81072aa03bc01b521a45d1dd", "title": "Semantic Web Search System Founded on Case-Based Reasoning and Ontology Learning", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Due to the unique data characteristics in specific scenarios, the primary challenge is to leverage discriminative fine-grained local information for improved mapping of images and text into a shared space. Current approaches interact with all multimodal local features for alignment, implicitly focusing on discriminative local information to distinguish data differences, which may bring noise and uncertainty. Furthermore, their VLP feature extractors like CLIP often focus on instance-level representations, potentially reducing the discriminability of fine-grained local features. To alleviate these issues, we propose an Explicit Key Local information Selection and Reconstruction Framework (EKLSR), which explicitly selects key local information to enhance feature representation. Specifically, we introduce a Key Local information Selection and Fusion (KLSF) that utilizes hidden knowledge from the VLP model to select interpretably and fuse key local information. Secondly, we employ Key Local segment Reconstruction (KLR) based on multimodal interaction to reconstruct the key local segments of images (text), significantly enriching their discriminative information and enhancing both inter-modal and intra-modal interaction alignment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on five datasets across TIReID and RSITR. Notably, our EKLSR model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two RSITR datasets."}, {"paperId": "007c56de3fd39f94698a1a13cb75591b9247d304", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007c56de3fd39f94698a1a13cb75591b9247d304", "title": "MULTI\u2212SCALE HISTOGRAMS FOR KERNEL\u2212BASED OBJECT TRACKING", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2608909", "name": "M.

In this study we used fMRI to examine retrieval performance emphasizing different aspects of episodic memory in the context of a spatial navigation paradigm. Subjects played a taxi-driver game (\"yellowcab\"), in which they freely searched for passengers and delivered them to specific landmark stores. Subjects then underwent fMRI scanning as they retrieved landmarks, spatial, and temporal associations from their navigational experience in three separate runs. Consistent with previous findings on item memory, perirhinal cortex activated most strongly during landmark retrieval compared with spatial or temporal source information retrieval. Both hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex activated significantly during retrieval of landmarks, spatial associations, and temporal order. We found, however, a significant dissociation between hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activations, with spatial retrieval leading to greater parahippocampal activation compared with hippocampus and temporal order retrieval leading to greater hippocampal activation compared with parahippocampal cortex. Our results, coupled with previous findings, demonstrate that the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are preferentially recruited during temporal order and spatial association retrieval--key components of episodic \"source\" memory."}, {"paperId": "007d43b1d9f5b6f7b15dc07491f7bc287d5e4ca7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007d43b1d9f5b6f7b15dc07491f7bc287d5e4ca7", "title": "Dynamic and Energy Efficient Cache Scheduling Framework for IoMT over ICN", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/21/11840/pdf?version=1698664911", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/app132111840?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/app132111840, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Massive traffic growth and user expectations cause challenges in the current exhausting models of IoMT data. To reduce the IoMT traffic, Information Centric Network (ICN) is a suitable technique. ICN uses persistent naming multicast communication that reduces the response time. ICN in IoMT provides a promising feature to reduce the overhead due to the distribution of commonly accessed contents. Some parameters such as energy consumption, communication cost, etc., influence the performance of sensors in the IoMT network. Excessive and unbalanced energy consumption degrades the network performance and lifetime. This article presents a framework called Dynamic Cache Scheme (DCS) that implements energy-efficient cache scheduling in IoMT over ICN to reduce network traffic. The proposed framework establishes a balance between the multi-hop traffic and data item freshness. The technique improves the freshness of data; thus, updated data are provided to the end-users via the effective utilization of caching in IoMT. The proposed framework is tested on important parameters, i.e., cache-hit-ratio, stretch, and content retrieval latency. The results obtained are compared with the state-of-the-art models. Results\u2019 analysis shows that the proposed framework outperforms the compared models in terms of cache-hit-ratio, stretch, and content retrieval latency by 59.42%, 32.66%, and 18.8%, respectively. In the future, it is intended to explore the applicability of DCS in more scenarios and optimize further."}, {"paperId": "007d45969a00c17bdbe60ee25194b5cc7694ffae", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007d45969a00c17bdbe60ee25194b5cc7694ffae", "title": "Natural Language Based Information Retrieval", "year": 1974, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "121729707", "name": "R.

These involves in complex formation and many pathways which are used to perform biological processes. By accurate identification of the set of interacting proteins can get rid of new light on the functional role of various proteins in the complex surroundings of the cell. The ability to construct biologically consequential gene networks and identification of the exact relationship in the gene network is critical for present-day systems biology. In earlier research, the power of presented gene modules to shed light on the functioning of complex biological systems is studied. Most of modules in these networks have shown small link with meaningful biological function, because these methods doesn't exactly calculate the semantic relationship between the entities. In order to overcome these problems and improve the PPI results in the biotext corpus a new method is proposed in this research. The proposed method which directly incorporates Gene Ontology (GO) annotation in construction of gene modules and Dictionary-based text is proposed to extract biotext information. Dictionary-Based Text and Gene Ontology (DBTGO) approach that integrates with various gene-gene pairwise similarity values, protein-protein interaction relationship obtained from gene expression, in order to gain better biotext information retrieval result. A result analysis has been carried out on Biotext Project at UC Berkley. Testing the DBTGO algorithm indicates that it is able to improve PPI relationship identification result with all previously suggested methods in terms of the precision, recall, F measure and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).

In the present study, we link belief and proof by introducing the notion of epistemic modality, which is concerned with the speaker\u2019s belief in propositional probability. The variation in the orientation of epistemic modality helps to integrate the two levels of proof and bridge the apparent test gap between them. The notion of relevance is further introduced in order to clarify the nature of legal proof by taking rape cases as example. This study also provides an integrated model to improve but diversify the expressions in terms of the burden of proof. For most courts, court judgments are processed only according to the general case data, procedural context; such kinds of fact-based information processing and information retrieval seldom help the court to make its decision unless with tremendous and repetitious work. For the consistency and efficiency of court adjudication, it is suggested in the present study that a Knowledge Management (KM) model mainly based on elements and factors which decide or affect the criminal liability.

Then we define the table structure recognition problem as a cell association classification problem and propose a conditional attention network (CATT-Net). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets. Besides, we investigate whether the alignment of a cell bounding box or a text-focused approach has more impact on the model performance. Due to the lack of public dataset annotations based on these two approaches, we further annotate the ICDAR2013 dataset providing both types of bounding boxes, which can be a new benchmark dataset for evaluating the methods in this field. Experimental results show that the alignment of a cell bounding box can help improve the Micro-averaged F1 score from 0.915 to 0.963, and the Macro-average F1 score from 0.787 to 0.923."}, {"paperId": "007f4bde7d2ed0d774e62820de600b2db4707a0d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007f4bde7d2ed0d774e62820de600b2db4707a0d", "title": "Fusion-layer-based machine vision for intelligent transportation systems", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40630660", "name": "Yajun Fang"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "007f738d4389ae8ae947e87b79da506ec964376e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007f738d4389ae8ae947e87b79da506ec964376e", "title": "Walking through a library remotely - Why we need maps for collections and how KnoweScape can help us to make them?", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.06776", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3166/lcn.11.1.103-127?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3166/lcn.11.1.103-127, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The question of how to order our knowledge is as old as the systematic acquisition, circulation, and storage of knowledge. Classification systems have been known since ancient times. On the Internet, one finds both classifications and taxonomies designed by information professionals and folksonomies based on social tagging. Nevertheless, a user navigating through large information spaces is still confronted with a text based search interface and a list of hits as outcome. There is still an obvious gap between a physical encounter with, for example, a librarys collection and browsing its content through an on-line catalogue. This paper starts from the need of digital scholarship for effective knowledge inquiry, revisits traditional ways to support knowledge ordering and information retrieval, and introduces into a newly funded research network where five different communities from all corners of the scientific landscape join forces in a quest for knowledge maps. It can be read as a manifesto for a newly funded specific research network KnoweScape. At the same time it is a general reflection about what one has to take into account when representing structure and evolution of data, information and knowledge and designing instruments to help scholars and others to navigate across the lands and oceans of knowledge."}, {"paperId": "0080a74929931092bbd18884627c8706cb6863c0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0080a74929931092bbd18884627c8706cb6863c0", "title": "Social Media Analysis to Enhance Sustainable Knowledge Management: A Concise Literature Review", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/13/9957/pdf?version=1687426515", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/su15139957?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/su15139957, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This can foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation while considering the social implications of knowledge sharing. The main goal of this study is to critically and holistically discuss the impact of social media analysis in the knowledge management process holistically and maximize its value in a given context. More concretely, we conducted a systematic literature review (2012\u20132022) based on the PRISMA guidelines. We first approached the ideal phases of the knowledge management process and then discussed key issues and challenges from an application perspective. Overall, the study points out the positive impact of social network analysis on knowledge sharing, creativity and productivity, knowledge formulation, building trust, and cognitive capital. Additionally, value is provided in knowledge acquisition by simplifying and massively gathering information, reducing uncertainty and ambiguity, and organizing knowledge through storage, retrieval, and classification practices. At an application level, such knowledge may improve the quality of services and encourage creativity.

Unfortunately, efficient optics for these wavelengths are difficult to manufacture or have limited resolution. For this reason, in the past few years, coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) applications become widely used. In CDI, the object is illuminated by a coherent beam and the diffraction intensity is collected by a 2D pixel detector. In this process, the phase information of the diffracted light is lost. A phase retrieval algorithm is then used to reconstruct the object\u2019s complex amplitude. Ptychography is a scanning version of coherent diffraction imaging and it is based on an iterative reconstruction algorithm that relies on the quality of the recorded diffraction intensity to converge. To obtain diffraction patterns with a high signal-to-noise ratio, a beam stop is used in many ptychography setups to avoid over-saturation and blooming effects on the detector. While using a beam stop in a ptychography setup has become common practice, the limits of affordable data loss due to beam stop have not been systematically investigated. Pixel masking is the conventional method to recover the lost frequencies. In this method, when enforcing the Fourier domain constraint, the invalid pixels are ignored. In the missing data region, the algorithm is allowed to keep the guess from the previous iteration. The illumination conditions of the ptychography experiment play a critical role in the signal recovery procedure. The diffraction pattern on the detector is the convolution of the Fourier transform of the object and the illumination. An illumination with a finite numerical aperture encodes the object information over a larger detector area. This makes the reconstruction algorithm more robust to pixel loss. We provide simulation and experimental results to demonstrate this theory."}, {"paperId": "0081696ec2fe1ff3650634c7c419c4a777894566", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0081696ec2fe1ff3650634c7c419c4a777894566", "title": "Data Integration using Semantic Technology: A use case", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Therefore, most prior studies focused on the role of synchronization for episodic memory, as reflected in theta (\u223c5 Hz) and gamma (>40 Hz) power increases. These studies, however, neglect the role that is played by neural desynchronization, which is usually reflected in power decreases in the alpha and beta frequency band (8\u201330 Hz). In this paper we present a first idea, derived from information theory that gives a mechanistic explanation of how neural desynchronization aids human memory encoding and retrieval. Thereby we will review current studies investigating the role of alpha and beta power decreases during long-term memory tasks and show that alpha and beta power decreases play an important and active role for human memory. Applying mathematical models of information theory, we demonstrate that neural desynchronization is positively related to the richness of information represented in the brain, thereby enabling encoding and retrieval of long-term memories. This information via desynchronization hypothesis makes several predictions, which can be tested in future experiments."}, {"paperId": "0084911d66f35d95a05d59a3dc4eb99d6dd4c36d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0084911d66f35d95a05d59a3dc4eb99d6dd4c36d", "title": "Research on the effects of alteration of the indigenous microflora of the monkey.

At present, there are many anti-counterfeiting technologies such as RFID tags, NFC tags, barcode, phosphor physical uncloneable function (PUF), laser security mark, and digital watermarking. In this paper, is proposed an anti-counterfeiting smart system based on digital object architecture (DOA) for products identification to protect them from counterfeiting. The main idea behind using DOA with IoT technologies gateways is to provide standard access to heterogeneous information and services about products such as identification, description, search and retrieval, security, integrity, trust and typing of data. This system gives effective technical references for enterprises to monitor whole life cycle of products with internet of things. At the end of this paper, we gave an example of using this method is to monitor the production of halal products."}, {"paperId": "0086beeed1be4e0ef06cc89df25ab1555a9f5ee4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0086beeed1be4e0ef06cc89df25ab1555a9f5ee4", "title": "Keywords LIS education Slovenia Ljubljana Bologna reform Curriculum Information seeking and retrieval Web 2.0 E-learning", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144003065", "name": "P.

The text-based approach, which uses verbal descriptions for image indexing and retrieval, is a dominant method adopted in the practitioner environment and Library and Information Science field; whereas the content-based approach relies on low-level features (color, shape, texture, etc.), and has been explored primarily by the field of Computer Science (Enser, 2008). The contentbased approach is practically adopted for special types of images, such as medical images, face and finger print recognition, trademark or logo searching, and so on, but for general images the content-based approach is still limited to the research environment.

The framework leverages state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning (DL) to handle the challenges of heterogeneous and unstructured data sources. The framework is a multi-staged approach. For data preparation, it employs heuristic and rule-based techniques for extracting data within scanned archive documents. After that, utilize the indexing approach to organize the extracted data. Furthermore, harness the power of the Large Language Model (LLM) to find the similarity between the user query and documents for information retrieval functionality. The proposed framework is evaluated in comparison with traditional approaches of data extraction, search, and information retrieval. This study shows that employing rule heuristics accelerates extraction time by targeting specific document parts. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate superior search speed with the IVF indexing method, and highlight the effectiveness of our innovative parallelism approach in optimizing query processing.

Its main function is to capture photons and convert them into electrical impulses that travel along the optic nerve to the brain where they are turned into images. It consists of neurons, nourishing blood vessels and different cell types, of which neural cells predominate. Defects in any of these cells can lead to a variety of retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis and glaucoma. Recent progress in genomics and microarray technology provides extensive opportunities to examine alterations in retinal gene expression profiles during development and diseases. However, there is no specific database that deals with retinal gene expression profiling. In this context we have built RETINOBASE, a dedicated microarray database for retina.DescriptionRETINOBASE is a microarray relational database, analysis and visualization system that allows simple yet powerful queries to retrieve information about gene expression in retina. It provides access to gene expression meta-data and offers significant insights into gene networks in retina, resulting in better hypothesis framing for biological problems that can subsequently be tested in the laboratory. Public and proprietary data are automatically analyzed with 3 distinct methods, RMA, dChip and MAS5, then clustered using 2 different K-means and 1 mixture models method. Thus, RETINOBASE provides a framework to compare these methods and to optimize the retinal data analysis. RETINOBASE has three different modules, \"Gene Information\", \"Raw Data System Analysis\" and \"Fold change system Analysis\" that are interconnected in a relational schema, allowing efficient retrieval and cross comparison of data. Currently, RETINOBASE contains datasets from 28 different microarray experiments performed in 5 different model systems: drosophila, zebrafish, rat, mouse and human. The database is supported by a platform that is designed to easily integrate new functionalities and is also frequently updated.ConclusionThe results obtained from various biological scenarios can be visualized, compared and downloaded. The results of a case study are presented that highlight the utility of RETINOBASE. Overall, RETINOBASE provides efficient access to the global expression profiling of retinal genes from different organisms under various conditions."}, {"paperId": "008f1d2741ebef51e6400686b050e046455b52fb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008f1d2741ebef51e6400686b050e046455b52fb", "title": "The whens and hows of learning to rank for web search", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

This experiment aims at investigating how stable boundary layers during wintertime conditions drive the accumulation of pollutants. In order to understand the atmospheric processes in the valley, MWR continuously provide vertical profiles of temperature and humidity at a high time frequency, providing valuable information to follow the evolution of the boundary layer. A one-dimensional variational (1DVAR) retrieval technique has been implemented during the field campaign to optimally combine MWR and 1 h forecasts from the French convective scale model AROME. Retrievals were compared to radiosonde data launched at least every 3 hours during two intensive observation periods (IOP). An analysis of the AROME forecast errors during the IOPs has shown a large underestimation of the surface cooling during the strongest stable episode. MWR brightness temperatures were monitored against simulations from the radiative transfer model ARTS2 (Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator) and radiosonde launched during the field campaign. Large errorswere observed for most transparent channels (i.e., 51\u201352 GHz) affected by absorption model and calibration uncertainties while a good agreement was found for opaque channels (i.e., 54\u201358 GHz). Based on this monitoring, a bias correction of raw brightness temperature measurements was applied before the 1DVAR retrievals. 1DVAR retrievals were found to significantly improve the AROME forecasts up to 3 km but mainly below 1 km and to outperform usual statistical regressions above 1 km. With the present implementation, a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 1 K through all the atmospheric profile was obtained with values within 0.5 K below 500 m in clear-sky conditions. The use of lower elevation angles (up to 5\u00b0) in the MWR scanning and the bias correction were found to improve the retrievals below 1000 m. MWR retrievals were found to catch very well deep nearsurface temperature inversions. Larger errors were observed in cloudy conditions due to difficulty of ground-based MWR to resolve high level inversions that are still challenging. Finally, 1DVAR retrievals were optimized for the analysis of the IOPs by using radiosondes as backgrounds in the 1DVAR algorithm instead of the AROME forecasts. A significant improvement of the retrievals in cloudy conditions and below 1000 m in clear-sky was observed. From this study, we can conclude that MWR are expected to bring valuable information into NWP models up to 3 km altitude both in clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions with the maximum improvement found around 500 m. With an accuracy between 0.5 and 1 K in RMSE, our study has also proved MWR to be capable of resolving deep near-surface temperature inversions observed in complex terrain during highly stable boundary layer conditions."}, {"paperId": "00904aef4d0692642c8360b9ce4c140c22757c2e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00904aef4d0692642c8360b9ce4c140c22757c2e", "title": "Determining phase coherence time of stored light in warm atomic vapor", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15469-4.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5686098, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, this study aims to reveal the process of metacognitive blindness that occurs during problem solving experienced by students with quite good academic performance. The data collected is in the form of words obtained through interviews and pictures of the work of research subjects. Description of data analysis and interpretation of the meaning of findings using text analysis. Analysis is carried out in all phases of problem solving, including analyzing, exploring, planning steps to solve problems, implementing a problem solving plan, and checking again. The results of qualitative analysis show that subjects who are students with good academic performance can experience anomalous results during the problem solving process. In this study, the anomalous result in question is a condition where the subject feels anomaly during the problem solving process, where the anomaly is actually not there. In this case, subjects who have good academic performance tend to have too much confidence. This makes the performance in the problem-solving process less optimal. Keyword: Self-confidence, Metacognitive Blindness, Problem-solving, Mathematics Learning INTRODUCTION Metacognitive abilities become the main indicator in achieving learning objectives (Jacobse & Harskamp, 2012). The involvement of metacognitive abilities becomes an important component in learning activities because it can encourage higher-order thinking skills (Wismath, Orr, & Good, 2014). Metacognition is defined as part of higher order thinking skills which includes understanding, analysis, and control of cognitive processes (Dorr & Perels, 2019). In this case, metacognition can support students in solving problems more effectively (Kim, Park, Moore, & Varma, 2013) and meaningfully (Hassan & Rahman, 2012; Safari & Arezy, 2012). In relation to the problem solving process, sometimes the subject is not aware of the mistakes that have been made which are hereinafter referred to as metacognitive blindness (Faradiba, Sa'dijah, Parta, & Rahardjo, 2019b). Metacognitive blindness is characterized by redflags during the problem solving process. Redflag is a warning to pause or step back to the previous problem solving stage, to subsequently take immediate action in the problem solving process (Goos, Galbraith, & Renshaw, 2000; Goos, 2002). There are three types of redflag in the problem solving process, namely lack of progress (lack of progress/LP), error detection (error detection/ED), and strange results (anomalous result/AR) (Goos, 2002). Each of the roles of redflag in metacognitive blindness can be explained as follows. First, the most common type of redflag is LP. LP is a condition when someone experiences an obstacle, deadlock in the problem solving process (Goos, 2002). This LP will cause metacognitive blindness when the subject is not recognized by the subject. In this case, the subject does not feel that he is facing obstacles or deadlocks so that the subject feels quite even though there are things that have not been successfully identified in the problem solving process. Second, the next type of redflag is ED. ED is a warning when a subject experiences a process error at the problem solving stage that requires the subject to check Surya Sari Faradiba, et al (Metacognitive Blindness in Mathematics Problem Solving) Journal of Education and Learning Mathematics Research | Volume 1, Number 2, 2020 44 and correct errors (Goos, Galbraith, & Renshaw, 2000). ED will cause metacognitive blindness when the subject is not aware of any mistakes that have been made so that the subject continues the problem solving process without checking or correcting the errors. Third, the last type of redflag is AR. AR is a condition where the subject finds an odd/ unusual condition (Goos, Galbraith, & Renshaw, 2000; Goos, 2002; Stillman, 2004; Ng, 2010). This AR will cause metacognitive blindness when the anomaly or unusual in the problem solving process is not realized by the subject and the subject takes the attitude to ignore it. Indicators of unusual occurrence can be known when subjects find conflicting information or conflicting solutions. So far, metacognitive blindness as a form of metacognitive failure always occurs in students who experience learning problems, for example students who experience math anxiety (Legg & Locker, 2009; Faradiba, Sa'dijah, Parta & Rahardjo, 2019b), students with impaired mathematics (Faradiba, Sa'dijah, Parta & Rahardjo, 2019a), or have unsatisfactory academic pretensions (Erickson & Heit, 2015). This study tries to uncover the phenomenon of metacognitive blindness that occurs in students with good academic achievement. The study in this study is expected to provide new insights related to metacognitive blindness as a form of metacognitive failure. METHOD This study aims to explore the problem and develop a detailed understanding of the phenomenon of mathematical anxiety in relation to the process of solving mathematical problems. Data collected in this study are in the form of words obtained through interviews, pictures of the subject's work in solving mathematical problems to get a picture of the subject's behavior. Description of data analysis and interpretation of the meaning of findings using text analysis. Research that has these characteristics is a qualitative study (Creswell, 2012; Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). This research is categorized in qualitative research type with the research strategy used is case study. Case study research strategy is a strategy in which researchers investigate carefully a program, event, activity, process or group of individuals (Creswell, 2012). The case study in question is the process of solving mathematical problems carried out by the subject. In this case, the researcher explores the process to obtain the research objective, which is to describe the occurrence of metacognitive blindness when solving mathematical problems experienced by students with good academic achievement. This research was conducted on students majoring in Mathematics Education, Universitas Islam Malang. The study lasted for four weeks. In the first week, researchers submit material related to mathematical problems that will be solved by the subject. In the second week, researchers collected data related to the subject's academic achievement in a number of courses taken in the previous semester. In the third week data collection was carried out in the form of subject work and interview results. In the fourth week the researchers analyzed and triangulated the data. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling in which prospective subjects were selected from students with the highest academic achievement in the class. In addition, researchers who are teaching staff at the university are also one of the considerations, thus supporting data retrieval in order to obtain the results of the subject's work and interviews that really describe the condition of the subject. Next, selected subject candidates are asked to solve mathematical problems. Mathematical problems are given to the subject to reveal the existence of redflag in every stage of the process of solving mathematical problems. The mathematical problems used in this study can be seen in"}, {"paperId": "0091c121010249d18a735a7ee464fee9c5fb80a7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0091c121010249d18a735a7ee464fee9c5fb80a7", "title": "Profile-based Datas and Recommendation for RDF Data Linking.

The methods use measurements of zenith radiance at 673 and 870 nm wavelengths and require the presence of green vegetation in the surrounding area. The test was conducted at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Oklahoma site during September\u2013November 2004. These methods work because at 673 nm (red) and 870 nm (near infrared (NIR)), clouds have nearly identical optical properties, while vegetated surfaces reflect quite differently. The first method, dubbed REDvsNIR, retrieves not only cloud optical depth \u03c4 but also radiative cloud fraction. Because of the 1-s time resolution of our radiance measurements, we are able for the first time to capture changes in cloud optical properties at the natural timescale of cloud evolution. We compared values of \u03c4 retrieved by REDvsNIR to those retrieved from downward shortwave fluxes and from microwave brightness temperatures. The flux method generally underestimates \u03c4 relative to the REDvsNIR method. Even for overcast but inhomogeneous clouds, differences between REDvsNIR and the flux method can be as large as 50%. In addition, REDvsNIR agreed to better than 15% with the microwave method for both overcast and broken clouds. The second method, dubbed COUPLED, retrieves \u03c4 by combining zenith radiances with fluxes. While extra information from fluxes was expected to improve retrievals, this is not always the case. In general, however, the COUPLED and REDvsNIR methods retrieve \u03c4 to within 15% of each other."}, {"paperId": "0095436baee0e3ff6c15591b5011250645b75924", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0095436baee0e3ff6c15591b5011250645b75924", "title": "APLIKASI TEXTSTAT SISTEM TEMU KEMBALI INFORMASI UNTUK MENGANALISA TEKS", "year": 1899, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49985932", "name": "Hendra"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "009574521c38c80868ae0efe61b2f20523cc7a96", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009574521c38c80868ae0efe61b2f20523cc7a96", "title": "Annotated document: Scoring and ranking method", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Moreover, since there is a wide range of applications of 3D models, how to quickly and effectively obtain the correct target model from the massive data has become a key issue. To date, 3D model retrieval approaches have been proposed, and in these approaches, view-based 3D model retrieval methods can achieve satisfactory performance. In the 3D model retrieval task, the latent relationship mining of all images in a 3D model, the adaptive fusion of different images, and the discriminative feature extraction are the main challenges, but in most existing solutions, these issues are separately performed and they are not explored in an end-to-end network architecture. To solve these issues, in this work, we propose a novel and effective multi-level view associative convolution network (MLVACN) to realize view-based 3D model retrieval, where the relationship exploration of multiple-view images, the fusion of different images, and the feature discrimination learning are realized in a unified end-to-end framework. Specifically, we design the group association layer and the block association layer to study the latent relationships among different views from the view-level and the block-level, respectively. Moreover, the weight fusion layer is further designed to adaptively fuse different views in a 3D model. In addition, these three layers are embedded into the MLVACN. Finally, the pairwise discrimination loss function is proposed to learn the discriminative features of the 3D model. Extensive experimental results on three 3D model retrieval datasets including ModelNet40, ModelNet10, and ShapeNetCore55 demonstrate that MLVACN can outperform state-of-the-art methods in term of mAP. When the ModelNet40 dataset is used, the mAP of MLVACN is improved by 13.25%, 7.75%, 3.95%, and 0.61% as compared to those of the MVCNN, GVCNN, PVNet, and MLVCNN methods, respectively."}, {"paperId": "0096f16fac108a0f7868896b0cd1f3a6085bd29a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0096f16fac108a0f7868896b0cd1f3a6085bd29a", "title": "Acute Psychosocial Stress and Prospective Memory : The mediating effect of working memory", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2081096686", "name": "Chamlesh Kissoondharry"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00972a129f175b4fb72a9638746879b5c1907779", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00972a129f175b4fb72a9638746879b5c1907779", "title": "KERNELS AND SIMILARITY MEASURES FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113367250", "name": "Andr\u00e9 F.

While a number of DHT classifications have been proposed to help organize these tools for discovery, retrieval, and comparison by health care organizations seeking to potentially implement them, none have specifically addressed that organizations considering their implementation approach the DHT discovery process with one or more specific outcomes in mind. An outcomes-based DHT ontology could therefore be valuable not only for health systems seeking to evaluate tools that influence certain outcomes, but also for regulators and vendors seeking to ascertain potential substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Objective This study aimed to develop, with inputs from industry, health care providers, payers, regulatory bodies, and patients through the Accelerated Digital Clinical Ecosystem (ADviCE) consortium, an ontology specific to DHT outcomes, the Digital medicine Outcomes Value Set (DOVeS), and to make this ontology publicly available and free to use. Methods From a starting point of a 4-generation\u2013deep hierarchical taxonomy developed by ADviCE, we developed DOVeS using the Web Ontology Language through the open-source ontology editor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and data from 185 vendors who had submitted structured product information to ADviCE. We used a custom, decentralized, collaborative ontology engineering methodology, and were guided by Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry principles. We incorporated the Mondo Disease Ontology (MONDO) and the Ontology of Adverse Events. After development, DOVeS was field-tested between December 2022 and May 2023 with 40 additional independent vendors previously unfamiliar with ADviCE or DOVeS. As a proof of concept, we subsequently developed a prototype DHT Application Finder leveraging DOVeS to enable a user to query for DHT products based on specific outcomes of interest. Results In its current state, DOVeS contains 42,320 and 9481 native axioms and distinct classes, respectively. These numbers are enhanced when taking into account the axioms and classes contributed by MONDO and the Ontology of Adverse Events. Conclusions DOVeS is publicly available on BioPortal and GitHub, and has a Creative Commons license CC-BY-SA that is intended to encourage stakeholders to modify, adapt, build upon, and distribute it. While no ontology is complete, DOVeS will benefit from a strong and engaged user base to help it grow and evolve in a way that best serves DHT stakeholders and the patients they serve."}, {"paperId": "0099f88c144d19a0dde270add681072c1cb68019", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0099f88c144d19a0dde270add681072c1cb68019", "title": "Methods used to estimate the collective dose in Denmark from diagnostic radiology", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "14011872", "name": "P.

Several validation studies have shown a notable overestimation of the clear sky ultraviolet (UV) irradiance at the Earth's surface derived from satellite sensors such as the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with respect to ground-based UV data at many locations. Most of this positive bias is attributed to boundary layer aerosol absorption that is not accounted for in the TOMS/OMI operational UV algorithm. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to analyse the aerosol effect on the bias between OMI erythemal UV irradiance (UVER) and spectral UV (305 nm, 310 nm and 324 nm) surface irradiances and ground-based Brewer spectroradiometer measurements from October 2004 to December 2008 at El Arenosillo station (37.1\u00b0 N, 6.7\u00b0 W, 20 m a.s.l.), with meteorological conditions representative of the South-West of Spain. The effects of other factors as clouds, ozone and the solar elevation over this intercomparison were analysed in detail in a companion paper (Anton et al., 2010). In that paper the aerosol effects were studied making only a rough evaluation based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) information at 440 nm wavelength (visible range) without applying any correction. We have used the precise information given by single scattering albedo (SSA) from AERONET for the determination of absorbing aerosols which has allowed the correction of the OMI UV data. An aerosol correction expression was applied to the OMI operational UV data using two approaches to estimate the UV absorption aerosol optical depth, AAOD. The first approach was based on an assumption of constant SSA value of 0.91. This approach reduces the OMI UVER bias against the reference Brewer data from 13.4% to 8.4%. Second approach uses daily AERONET SSA values reducing the bias only to 11.6%. Therefore we have obtained a 37% and 12% of improvement respectively. For the spectral irradiance at 324 nm, the OMI bias is reduced from 10.5% to 6.98% for constant SSA and to 9.03% for variable SSA. Similar results were obtained for spectral irradiances at 305 nm, and 310 nm. Contrary to what was expected, the constant SSA approach has a greater bias reduction than variable SSA, but this is a reasonable result according to the discussion about the reliability of SSA values. Our results reflect the level of accuracy that may be reached at the present time in this type of comparison, which may be considered as satisfactory taking into account the remaining dependence on other factors. Nevertheless, improvements must be accomplished to determine reliable absorbing aerosol properties, which appear as a limiting factor for improving OMI retrievals."}, {"paperId": "009a0619e490ef773c3cac556ab43214289a0e28", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009a0619e490ef773c3cac556ab43214289a0e28", "title": "Crowdsourcing based terminal positioning using linear and non-linear interpolation techniques", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

To address these problems, this paper proposes a method for fabric retrieval based on a dual attention mechanism. The method inserts a dual attention mechanism module into the convolutional neural network, firstly strip attention module, which connects long and distant image information to capture narrow feature regions, and secondly the channel attention module, which adaptively recalibrates the channel feature responses and selects the prominent and effective feature maps. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs superiorly in fabric image retrieval, and DAMNet is proposed to solve the problem of feature extraction and retrieval of such fabric images."}, {"paperId": "009cbdab906dee50f21af83ffae01e63a0838cbd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009cbdab906dee50f21af83ffae01e63a0838cbd", "title": "Relying on accessible content versus accessibility experiences: The case of processing capacity", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1521/SOCO.2007.25.6.853?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1521/SOCO.2007.25.6.853, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Moreover, it has also been shown that image global representation generated by aggregating deep convolutional features provides excellent performance for image retrieval. In this paper we propose a novel aggregation method, which utilizes the information of retrieval object parts. The proposed part-based weighting aggregation (PWA) method utilizes the normalized feature maps as part detectors to weight and aggregate the convolutional features. The part detectors which are selected by the unsupervised method highlight the discriminative parts of objects and effectively suppress the noise of background. We experiment on five public standard datasets for image retrieval. Our unsupervised PWA method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches based on pre-trained networks and achieves comparable accuracy with the fine-tuned methods. It is worth noting that our unsupervised method is very suitable and effective for the situation where the annotated training dataset is difficult to collect."}, {"paperId": "009d67c4739dfb2ebc70ab86467e9ed5f228470a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009d67c4739dfb2ebc70ab86467e9ed5f228470a", "title": "Review of Profiling Machines: Mapping the Personal Information Economy", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

We also prove that the extended IT-2 FSMs satisfy many common properties (i.e., reflexivity, transivity, symmetry, and overlapping). Experiments are carried out on a variety of datasets including UCI learning machine and real data. Comparative studies between the proposed IT-2 FSMs and the other well-known existing similarity measures (Gorzalczany, Bustince, Mitchell, Zeng, and Li as well as VSM and Jaccard) are performed. Obviously, the best results are obtained with the IT-2 FSMs being resilient to the high levels of uncertainty noise. We also prove that our IT-2 FSMs can overcome the drawbacks of some existing similarity measures based on the accuracy rate measure. In addition, the proposed IT-2 FSMs are joined with fuzzy C-means algorithm as a clustering method and the proposed system is compared against the existing clustering algorithms (type-1 fuzzy k-means, type-1, and type-2 fuzzy C-means, cluster forest, bagged clustering, evidence accumulation, and random projection). Relying on the clustering quality parameters R and C (equivalent to the standard classification accuracy), the advanced IT-2FSMs show higher classification accuracy of about 86% which outperforms nearly the other classifiers."}, {"paperId": "00a006e4c96a52bfcc63e5b4d1b8cb1e13402fd5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a006e4c96a52bfcc63e5b4d1b8cb1e13402fd5", "title": "Why can\u2019t I manage academic papers like MP3s?

Most top-performing methods primarily leverage Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract video features (Lei et al., 2021}, (Bain et al., 2021), (Wang et al., 2022). However, they suffer from the high computational complexity of ViT, especially when encoding long videos. A common and simple solution is to uniformly sample a small number (e.g., 4 or 8) of frames from the target video (instead of using the whole video) as ViT inputs. The number of frames has a strong influence on the performance of ViT, e.g., using 8 frames yields better performance than using 4 frames but requires more computational resources, resulting in a trade-off. To get free from this trade-off, this paper introduces an automatic video compression method based on a bilevel optimization program (BOP) consisting of both model-level (i.e., base-level) and frame-level (i.e., meta-level) optimizations. The model-level optimization process learns a cross-modal video retrieval model whose input includes the \u201ccompressed frames\u201d learned by frame-level optimization. In turn, frame-level optimization is achieved through gradient descent using the meta loss of the video retrieval model computed on the whole video. We call this BOP method (as well as the \u201ccompressed frames\u201d) the Meta-Optimized Frames (MOF) approach. By incorporating MOF, the video retrieval model is able to utilize the information of whole videos (for training) while taking only a small number of input frames in its actual implementation. The convergence of MOF is guaranteed by meta gradient descent algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we conduct extensive cross-modal video retrieval experiments on three large-scale benchmarks: MSR-VTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results show that MOF is a generic and efficient method that boost multiple baseline methods, and can achieve a new state-of-the-art performance."}, {"paperId": "00a610a714df5529fac8304ca6e2c3117241cb9f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a610a714df5529fac8304ca6e2c3117241cb9f", "title": "A feedforward/feedback approach to retrieval of a tethered sub-satellite", "year": 1990, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "70155256", "name": "Eric J.

In this paper, two mixture-prior generative models are proposed, under the objective to produce high-quality hashing codes for documents. Specifically, a Gaussian mixture prior is first imposed onto the variational auto-encoder (VAE), followed by a separate step to cast the continuous latent representation of VAE into binary code. To avoid the performance loss caused by the separate casting, a model using a Bernoulli mixture prior is further developed, in which an end-to-end training is admitted by resorting to the straight-through (ST) discrete gradient estimator. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods, especially the one using Bernoulli mixture priors, consistently outperform existing ones by a substantial margin."}, {"paperId": "00acc58211f23d0b37df34462d2f459cb0a60949", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00acc58211f23d0b37df34462d2f459cb0a60949", "title": "Research and prospect on multimedia information retrieval", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72309540", "name": "Jia Yu-ying"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00acf5af21aafee3bdaca0c851875256cca92cd8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00acf5af21aafee3bdaca0c851875256cca92cd8", "title": "Reasoning in Expressive Description Logics using Belief Networks", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "70155150", "name": "R.

Attributed networks, consisting of nodes, edges as well as attributes describing properties of nodes, are a basic type of network-based data, and are especially useful for many applications. Examples include user profiling in social networks and item recommendation in user-item purchase networks. Learning useful and expressive representations of entities in attributed networks can provide more effective building blocks to down-stream network-based tasks such as link prediction and attribute inference. Practically, input features of attributed networks are normalized as unit directional vectors. However, most network embedding techniques ignore the spherical nature of inputs and focus on learning representations in a Gaussian or Euclidean space, which, we hypothesize, might lead to less effective representations. To obtain more effective representations of attributed networks, we investigate the problem of mapping an attributed network with unit normalized directional features into a non-Gaussian and non-Euclidean space. Specifically, we propose a hyperspherical variational co-embedding for attributed networks (HCAN), which is based on generalized variational auto-encoders for heterogeneous data with multiple types of entities. HCAN jointly learns latent embeddings for both nodes and attributes in a unified hyperspherical space such that the affinities between nodes and attributes can be captured effectively. We argue that this is a crucial feature in many real-world applications of attributed networks. Previous Gaussian network embedding algorithms break the assumption of uninformative prior, which leads to unstable results and poor performance. In contrast, HCAN embeds nodes and attributes as von Mises-Fisher distributions, and allows one to capture the uncertainty of the inferred representations. Experimental results on eight datasets show that HCAN yields better performance in a number of applications compared with nine state-of-the-art baselines."}, {"paperId": "00ad1fe1743da2a3e767ab9b8d625d5f77f5f822", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ad1fe1743da2a3e767ab9b8d625d5f77f5f822", "title": "A New Texture Image Retrieval for Tourism Industry", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "71541372", "name": "R.

Improvements include arylsulfonyltetrazoles as faster and milder condensing agents, benzenesulfonic acid to avoid depurination during deblocking of trityl protecting groups and improved chromatographic procedures for purification of triester intermediates and purification of the final product containing 3'-5' phosphodiester linkages. The efficiency of these new modifications in terms of yields and time has been illustrated by the synthesis of various defined sequences related to the lactose-operator region of E. coli, its analogues and two restriction enzyme recognition regions. INTRODUCTION The synthetic availability of various deoxyribooligonucleotides containing the sequence of various control regions of a gene could be of great importance in the study of the mechanism of sequence specific DNA-protein interaction. The triester chemical method3 seems to offer the first opportunity for large scale synthesis of oligonucleotides. Previously, we reported on the use of modified triester method developed in our laboratory for the chemical synthesis of a 21-mer duplex with demonstrated biological activity of the lactose operator gene of E. coli4'1. During these studies we developed arylsulfonyltriazoles5 as new coupling reagents which were found to give much higher yields of condensation products especially in the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing guanine base. However, these reagents were rather slow in completing the condensation reactions 1 (3-5 days) .

In today's research environment, exposure to bioinformatics training is something that anyone embarking on life sciences research is likely to need at some point. Furthermore, as research technologies evolve, this need will continue to grow. In fact, as a consequence of the introduction of high-throughput technologies, there has already been an increase in demand for training relating to the use of computational resources and tools designed for high-throughput data storage, retrieval, and analysis. Biologists and computational scientists alike are seeking postgraduate learning opportunities in various bioinformatics topics that meet the needs and time restrictions of their schedules. Short, intensive bioinformatics courses (typically from a couple of days to a week in length, and covering a variety of topics) are available throughout the world, and more continue to be developed to meet the growing training needs. The challenges, however, when planning, organising, and delivering such courses, are not trivial [1], especially considering the heterogeneous backgrounds of participants. Here, we address such challenges and present a consensus of rules derived from the shared expertise of several bioinformatics trainers. While the rules apply broadly to bioinformatics training, aspects addressing specific audiences are also discussed in order to make these rules pragmatic and applicable to a wide range of readers. Delivering bioinformatics training is both crucial to facilitate the use of, and to exploit the investment in, bioinformatics tools and resources, and an excellent opportunity to solicit user evaluation and feedback to improve them. One point of crucial interest to the training course community concerns material preparation and distribution. Preparing effective materials (slides, notes, references, etc.) entails a huge effort that would be enormously facilitated if course developers could start from a body of available materials, for example if they could gain access to repositories of materials deposited by trainers of other courses. This was one of the reasons motivating the Bioinformatics Training Network (BTN) to set up the BTN website (http://www.biotnet.org/), which has been planned as a vessel for the training community to share and disseminate course information and materials. Course developers are warmly welcome to subscribe to the site and make available their materials to the community [2]."}, {"paperId": "00ae315f623d143d6ecd67cb130efd88279fc2d5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ae315f623d143d6ecd67cb130efd88279fc2d5", "title": "An Approach to Generate a Caption for an Image Collection Using Scene Graph Generation", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10315005.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3332098?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3332098, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Text summarization is a popular task of determining the topic or generating a textual summary of documents. In contrast, image summarization aims to find a representative summary of a collection of images. However, current methods are still restricted to generating a visual scene graph, tags, and noun phrases, but cannot generate a fitting textual description of an image collection. Thus, we introduce a novel framework for generating a summarized caption of an image collection. Since scene graph generation shows advancement in describing objects and their relationships on a single image, we use it in the proposed method to generate a scene graph for each image in an image collection. Then, we find common objects and their relationships from all scene graphs and represent them as a summarized scene graph. For this, we merge all scene graphs and select part of it by estimating the most common objects and relationships. Finally, the summarized scene graph is input into a captioning model. In addition, we introduce a technique to generalize specific words in the final caption into common concept words incorporating external knowledge. To evaluate the proposed method, we construct a dataset for this task by extending the annotation of the MS-COCO dataset using an image retrieval method. The evaluation of the proposed method on this dataset showed promising performance compared to text summarization-based methods."}, {"paperId": "00ae5a75fbf6b9016d0120f48db096a2e561d2aa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ae5a75fbf6b9016d0120f48db096a2e561d2aa", "title": "Chapter 2 Entity Ranking : Searching Entities", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113570861", "name": "Tao Cheng"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00afae62387e712894e64bf5ea631b68dda81a0c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00afae62387e712894e64bf5ea631b68dda81a0c", "title": "On comparing edit distance and geometric frameworks in content-based retrieval of symbolically encoded polyphonic music", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Hyperspectral data has great potential for vegetation parameter retrieval. However, due to angular effects resulting from different sun-surface-sensor geometries, objects might appear differently depending on the position of an object within the field of view of a sensor. Recently, lightweight snapshot cameras have been introduced, which capture hyperspectral information in two spatial and one spectral dimension and can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles. This study investigates the influence of the different viewing geometries within an image on the apparent hyperspectral reflection retrieved by these sensors. Additionally, it is evaluated how hyperspectral vegetation indices like the NDVI are effected by the angular effects within a single image and if the viewing geometry influences the apparent heterogeneity with an area of interest. The study is carried out for a barley canopy at booting stage. The results show significant influences of the position of the area of interest within the image. The red region of the spectrum is more influenced by the position than the near infrared. The ability of the NDVI to compensate these effects was limited to the capturing positions close to nadir. The apparent heterogeneity of the area of interest is the highest close to a nadir."}, {"paperId": "00b235c796c3b646eb401dc8d81756aa76928536", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b235c796c3b646eb401dc8d81756aa76928536", "title": "Some Strategies of Marketing Academic Library to College Students", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In this study, we present a comprehensive insight into the information content of POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance-3 (POLDER-3) and multiviewing, multichannel, multipolarization imager (3MI) observations for aerosol retrievals and estimate posterior errors of corresponding parameters based on the Bayesian theory.

Any tool which could help reduce the time taken for the resolution of a case is invaluable. Common legal systems place a great importance on precedents and retrieving the correct set of precedents is considerably time consuming. Hence, for any case whose proceedings are in progress, if there are suitable prior cases, then the court has to follow the same interpretations that were passed in the prior cases. This is to ensure that similar situations receive similar treatment, thus maintaining uniformity amongst the legal proceedings across all courts at all times. Hence, precedent cases are treated as important as any other written law (a statute) in this legal system. In this paper, we propose two new approaches to solve this information retrieval problem wherein the system accepts the current case document as the query and returns the relevant precedent cases as the result. The first approach is to calculate the document similarity using Wordnet, which is a lexical database that could be leveraged to quantify the semantic relatedness between two documents, using a semantic network. The second approach is the use of a Siamese Manhattan Long Short Term Memory network, which is a supervised model trained to understand the underlying similarity between two documents."}, {"paperId": "00b2ecd842510b69eb215e2042dda59fd20c4a21", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b2ecd842510b69eb215e2042dda59fd20c4a21", "title": "An approach to manage semantic heterogeneity in unstructured P2P information retrieval systems", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00731848/file/Main.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/P2P.2012.6335798?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/P2P.2012.6335798, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

DiQuESh is a top-k algorithm for distributed information retrieval that is intended to ensure interoperability. This distinction enables highlighting their respective benefits on the IR performances and leads to a modular architecture. For our experiments we obtained a set of actively used real-world ontologies through the NCBO BioPortal. We implemented GoOD-TA and DiQuESH in Java and used the PeerSim simulator. We first show that GoOD-TA nicely reduces the semantic heterogeneity related to the system topology, handles the evolution of peers' descriptors, and is suitable for dynamic systems. Then, GoOD-TA and DiQuESh are run simultaneously, with a significant increase of precision and recall. This enables to identify the indirect contribution of heterogeneity reduction obtained with GoOD-TA to improving interoperability."}, {"paperId": "00b2fda27e650c4899a026808d206ceca447d961", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b2fda27e650c4899a026808d206ceca447d961", "title": "Research on the Creative Idea Recognition Method Based on Information Retrieval in Product Innovation", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1411322389", "name": "Xie Lu-ning"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00b2fe630bcd80a22a2456db2981eb98d50a4a61", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b2fe630bcd80a22a2456db2981eb98d50a4a61", "title": "Revolutionizing Campus Communication: NLP-Powered University Chatbots", "year": 2024, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume15No6/Paper_6-Revolutionizing_Campus_Communication.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14569/ijacsa.2024.0150606?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2024.0150606, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Abstract \u2014Artificial intelligence (AI) based chatbots leverage programmed software instructions to simulate human speech and user interaction. These versatile tools can be employed in various domains, from managing smart home devices to providing personal virtual assistants. They can also be useful in responding to common queries and can make information easier to access. In response to this need, we developed a specialized chatbot tailored for the academic environment by training an NLP model to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) the need of searching through the university website. The main goal is to optimize user engagement and streamline information retrieval within a university setting. By employing ML and NLP techniques, we enhance the chatbot's capabilities, enabling it to provide effective and precise answers, contributing to a more seamless and efficient experience for users seeking information about the university. The study discusses the pivotal decision-making process between implementing a custom neural network and the BERT model. Through a comparative analysis, the custom neural network emerges as the preferred solution, displaying efficiency, quick deployment, and superior accuracy in handling task-specific queries. While BERT presents unparalleled versatility in natural language processing, its resource-intensive pre-training, and challenges in adapting to the intricacies of the university-specific dataset limit its efficiency in this application. This research emphasizes the importance of customization to meet the unique demands of a university chatbot, providing valuable insights for developers seeking to strike a balance between efficiency and specialization in similar applications."}, {"paperId": "00b311f7dc3ab075c5445e3f5833691da2ecc23f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b311f7dc3ab075c5445e3f5833691da2ecc23f", "title": "Regular expression searching in Chinese information retrieval", "year": 1989, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118759232", "name": "Yunhua Shi"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00b36c57052f9cb2e6e39ed1106fd7a51920cec0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b36c57052f9cb2e6e39ed1106fd7a51920cec0", "title": "CMT in TREC-COVID Round 2: Mitigating the Generalization Gaps from Web to Special Domain Search", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01580, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our decision processes, emotions and interactions with the world around us are based on and driven by associations to our memories. This natural association paradigm will become critical in future memory systems, namely, the key question will not be \u201cHow do I store more information?\u201d but rather, \u201cDo I have the relevant information? How do I retrieve it?\u201d The focus of this paper is to make a first step in this direction. We define and solve a very basic problem in associative retrieval. Given a word W, the words in the memory that are t-associated with W are the words in the ball of radius t around W. In general, given a set of words, say W, X and Y, the words that are t-associated with {W, X, Y} are those in the memory that are within distance t from all the three words. Our main goal is to study the maximum size of the t-associated set as a function of the number of input words and the minimum distance of the words in memory - we call this value the uncertainty of an associative memory. We derive the uncertainty of the associative memory that consists of all the binary vectors with an arbitrary number of input words. In addition, we study the retrieval problem, namely, how do we get the t-associated set given the inputs? We note that this paradigm is a generalization of the sequences reconstruction problem that was proposed by Leven-shtein (2001). In this model, a word is transmitted over multiple channels. A decoder receives all the channel outputs and decodes the transmitted word. Levenshtein computed the minimum number of channels that guarantee a successful decoder - this value happens to be the uncertainty of an associative memory with two input words."}, {"paperId": "00b52c6ed5efa7ab1b98dfdab82f8a85ed793148", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b52c6ed5efa7ab1b98dfdab82f8a85ed793148", "title": "Lessons Learned from Implant Retrieval of Ceramic Bearings: A Case Study", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

To acquire quickly CAD assembly models associated with specific functions by using product function requirement information in the product conceptual design phase for model reuse, this paper aims to find an approach for structure-function correlations analysis and functional semantic annotation of mechanical CAD assembly model before functional semantic-based assembly retrieval.Design/methodology/approachAn approach for structure-function correlations analysis and functional semantic annotation of CAD assembly model is proposed. First, the product knowledge model is constructed based on ontology including design knowledge and function knowledge. Then, CAD assembly model is represented by part attributed adjacency graph and partitioned into multiple functional regions. Assembly region and flow-activity region are defined for structure-function correlations analysis of CAD assembly model. Meanwhile, the extraction process of assembly region and flow-activity region is given in detail. Furthermore, structure-function correlations analysis and functional semantic annotation are achieved by considering comprehensively assembly structure and assembled part shape structure in CAD assembly model. After that, a structure-function relation model is established based on polychromatic sets for expressing explicitly and formally relationships between functional structures, assembled parts and functional semantics.FindingsThe correlation between structure and function is analyzed effectively, and functional semantics corresponding to structures in CAD assembly model are labeled. Additionally, the relationships between functional structures, assembled parts and functional semantics can be described explicitly and formally.Practical implicationsThe approach can be used to help designers accomplish functional semantic annotation of CAD assembly models in model repository, which provides support for functional semantic-based CAD assembly retrieval in the product conceptual design phase. These assembly models can be reused for product structure design and assembly process design.Originality/valueThe paper proposes a novel approach for structure-function correlations analysis and functional semantic annotation of mechanical CAD assembly model. Functional structures in assembly model are extracted and analyzed from the point of view of assembly structure and function part structure. Furthermore, the correlation relation between structures, assembled parts and functional semantics is expressed explicitly and formally based on polychromatic sets."}, {"paperId": "00b583e29e5c63548d0da7869a4416b18dbd70a7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b583e29e5c63548d0da7869a4416b18dbd70a7", "title": "Diversifying the Legal Order", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01557597/file/430537_1_En_44_Chapter.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/978-3-319-44944-9_44?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44944-9_44, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Data has become an integral part of everyone\u2019s day-to-day lives. The data which is processed, organized and structured or presented in a given context is information. Information is both being collected as well as generated at exponential rates every second. With this spike in interest in information, retrieving it is a key field of study. Information retrieval is the technique of obtaining information relevant to a query from a collection of information resources. To achieve high accuracy in providing users with information, sub- collections of data called verticals are often employed. Common verticals include news, health, academic, jobs, shopping, etc. Our primary goal is to extract information that is most relevant to the specified query. Federated web search is an information retrieval technology to scour through several search engines and databases for every query posed by the user. It then aggregates these results for presentation to the user. Our aim is to implement one of the tasks in federated web search that is resource selection. We need to select the right search engine for a given query; from various search engines available today.

Web usage mining is a technology to mine valuable knowledge from the World Wide Web. It intends to discover interesting user access patterns from web log files. Analysis of these user access patterns is used to determine that the information architecture of the web site can be reorganized to better facilitate information retrieval. Association rule mining is also used to find association relationships amongst large data sets. Mining frequent sequential patterns is a significant aspect in association rule mining. Based on this, the changes can be suggested to the web site by placing embedded hyperlinks on the home page to the frequently accessed sections of the web site.

We study this problem in two different scenarios: camera-based sheet music identification and MIDI-sheet image retrieval. Our proposed method combines bootleg score features with a novel hashing scheme called dynamic N-gram fingerprinting. This hashing scheme ensures that every fingerprint is discriminative enough to warrant a table lookup, which improves both retrieval accuracy and runtime. On experiments using all piano sheet music images in the IMSLP database, the proposed method achieves > 0.8 mean reciprocal rank with sub-second runtimes. As a practical application, we use our system to find matches between the Lakh MIDI dataset and IMSLP, which augments the IMSLP sheet music data with symbolic music information for a subset of pieces. We release our code and Lakh-IMSLP matches to facilitate future study."}, {"paperId": "00bc156bac2b39fab1689fe047b23c9f216d7f29", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00bc156bac2b39fab1689fe047b23c9f216d7f29", "title": "Database resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information: update", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc308807", "status": "GREEN", "license": "unspecified-oa", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC308807, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Zoomer is designed for tackling two challenges presented by the massive user data at Taobao: low training/serving efficiency due to the huge scale of the graphs, and low recommendation quality due to the information overload which distracts the recommendation model from specific user intentions. Zoomer achieves this by introducing a key concept, Region of Interests (ROI) in GNNs for recommendations, i.e., a neighborhood region in the graph with significant relevance to a strong user intention. Zoomer narrows the focus from the whole graph and \u201czooms in\u201d on the more relevant ROIs, thereby reducing the training/serving cost and mitigating the information overload at the same time. With carefully designed mechanisms, Zoomer identifies the interest expressed by each recommendation request, constructs an ROI subgraph by sampling with respect to the interest, and guides the GNN to reweigh different parts of the ROI towards the interest by a multi-level attention module. Deployed as a large-scale distributed system, Zoomer supports graphs with billions of nodes for training and thousands of requests per second for serving. Zoomer achieves up to 14x speedup when downsizing sampling scales with comparable (even better) AUC performance than baseline methods. Besides, both the offline evaluation and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of Zoomer."}, {"paperId": "00bd1201565c910e34aead9b7b233f3610700477", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00bd1201565c910e34aead9b7b233f3610700477", "title": "Obtaining Agricultural Information Resources on Internet", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2081920264", "name": "Dong Kaiju"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00bd8c95f106c6c8883a32ed8c1a9b270b892100", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00bd8c95f106c6c8883a32ed8c1a9b270b892100", "title": "Global invariant methods for object recognition", "year": 2001, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

It focuses on building a structured relationship of knowledge by analyzing information from various documents and databases, including the research database, the online information resource database (OPAC), the Northern Thai Information Center of the Chiang Mai University Library, the online information resource database of Rajamangalaphisek National Library, Chiang Mai, the online information resource database (OPAC) of the National Library of Thailand, the Oce of Arts and Culture, Chiang Mai Rajabhat University, and the online database from Sirindhorn Anthropological Center. This research tackles inefficiencies in retrieving and managing information on ancient Lanna documents through the development of a semantic ontology. The aim is to enhance the organization, classification, and accessibility of these documents, thereby improving search capabilities and knowledge dissemination. The innovation of this research lies in the development and evaluation of a semantic ontology specifically tailored for ancient Lanna documents. This ontology facilitates more effective grouping, categorization, and retrieval of information, significantly enhancing access to and utilization of ancient knowledge. A key innovation of this research is the application of ontology and semantic web technologies to the study of ancient Lanna documents. The research presents a structured approach to developing and validating the ontology, utilizing tools like Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and involving expert evaluations to ensure accuracy and relevance. The research process is divided into three stages. Stage 1 involves determining the need for an ontology by analyzing online data and grouping related keywords and phrases through the study of various information resources, including digital collections of ancient Lanna documents. Stage 2 focuses on developing the ontology using the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program, which involves designing classes, setting main classes, subclasses, hierarchies, and properties to create data relations within each class. Stage 3 encompasses the ontology assessment, which is divided into two parts: evaluating the appropriateness of the ontology structure by experts through a questionnaire on class correlation validity and assessing word grouping in ancient Lanna documents. The study's findings indicate that the identication of denitions, scope, and development objectives is appropriate (mean score = 0.88), with high scores in class grouping and ordering (score = 0.90), naming relationships and properties (score = 0.90), and the overall preciseness and appropriateness of the ontology development for ancient Lanna documents (score = 0.89)."}, {"paperId": "00c4f76afc050510d2ca62b5d821f6d75e47bb10", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c4f76afc050510d2ca62b5d821f6d75e47bb10", "title": "KiPar, a tool for systematic information retrieval regarding parameters for kinetic modelling of yeast metabolic pathways", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-pdf/25/11/1404/48987782/bioinformatics_25_11_1404.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp175?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp175, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These shortcomings become particularly acute in systems biology, where these parameters need to be integrated into detailed, genome-scale, metabolic models. These problems are addressed by KiPar, a dedicated information retrieval system designed to facilitate access to the literature relevant for kinetic modelling of a given metabolic pathway in yeast. Searching for kinetic data in the context of an individual pathway offers modularity as a way of tackling the complexity of developing a full metabolic model. It is also suitable for large-scale mining, since multiple reactions and their kinetic parameters can be specified in a single search request, rather than one reaction at a time, which is unsuitable given the size of genome-scale models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe developed an integrative approach, combining public data and software resources for the rapid development of large-scale text mining tools targeting complex biological information. The user supplies input in the form of identifiers used in relevant data resources to refer to the concepts of interest, e.g. EC numbers, GO and SBO identifiers. By doing so, the user is freed from providing any other knowledge or terminology concerned with these concepts and their relations, since they are retrieved from these and cross-referenced resources automatically. The terminology acquired is used to index the literature by mapping concepts to their synonyms, and then to textual documents mentioning them. The indexing results and the previously acquired knowledge about relations between concepts are used to formulate complex search queries aiming at documents relevant to the user's information needs. The conceptual approach is demonstrated in the implementation of KiPar. Evaluation reveals that KiPar performs better than a Boolean search. The precision achieved for abstracts (60%) and full-text articles (48%) is considerably better than the baseline precision (44% and 24%, respectively). The baseline recall is improved by 36% for abstracts and by 100% for full text. It appears that full-text articles are a much richer source of information on kinetic data than are their abstracts. Finally, the combined results for abstracts and full text compared with the curated literature provide high values for relative recall (88%) and novelty ratio (92%), suggesting that the system is able to retrieve a high proportion of new documents.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nSource code and documentation are available at: (http://www.mcisb.org/resources/kipar/)."}, {"paperId": "00c5f0fb5b5689665be2406cb95647e9c572e60e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c5f0fb5b5689665be2406cb95647e9c572e60e", "title": "Information retrieval system, and a program information retrieval method", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72828923", "name": "\u5927\u6c5f\u5c1a\u4e4b"}, {"authorId": "73450288", "name": "\u5fd7\u6469\u8d35\u6d69"}, {"authorId": "71430479", "name": "\u524d\u4e00\u6811"}, {"authorId": "71804734", "name": "\u658b\u85e4\u6d69"}, {"authorId": "71472378", "name": "\u5357\u4e95\u4f51\u4ecb"}, {"authorId": "71957629", "name": "\u66fe\u6839\u7530\u4eae"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00c60a3318ca55f108388efa383b38a8907b0632", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c60a3318ca55f108388efa383b38a8907b0632", "title": "Predicting Design-Induced Error on the Flight Deck", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/440774/1/Predictingdesigninducederrorontheflightdeck_Anaircraftengineoilleakscenario.doc", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/0018720819872900?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720819872900, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Parpura"}], "abstract": "Ever since memory deficits were characterized in patient H.M. (Scoville and Milner, 1957), it has become clear that the hippocampal region is an important player in memory acquisition and retrieval. Not to mention that memory is of paramount importance for maintaining relationships, achieving personal and professional goals, and carrying out even simple day-to-day activities. Scientists have been interested in understanding the basic mechanism by which our brain perceives and processes information, stores, and then later on (when required) retrieves it. Sometimes it is not possible to retrieve relevant information unless we recall events (context) associated with the memory trace. This begs a few questions: Why is the memory retrieval depressed or enhanced under some conditions? Is this a function of long-term synaptic facilitation or depression? If so, what are the processes that underlie synaptic facilitation or depression? \n \nWith the technological advancements made in the past 3\u20134 decades, it has been possible to start addressing these questions by recording spiking activity from a single neuron or a population of neurons (i.e., Local Field Potentials, LFPs) during memory acquisition and retrieval (Fried et al., 1997). It is widely believed that LFPs are the spatially weighted averages of synaptic currents (Kraskov et al., 2007). These synaptic currents are in some cases facilitated even though the amplitude and frequency of stimulating protocol is unchanged\u2014a phenomenon widely known as long-term potentiation (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). Synchronized synaptic activity within specialized brain regions, recorded as LFPs, have been reported during events of memory acquisition and retrieval (Eldridge et al., 2000; Kraskov et al., 2007) but the fundamental processes involved in this coordinated activity of neurons are still mainly unknown (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006). \n \nAstrocytes have emerged as an important player in synaptic plasticity in the past two decades. These glial cells were considered merely a \u201cglue\u201d for the most part of the last century till it was demonstrated that astrocytes respond to glutamate, a neurotransmitter released by excitatory neurons, by increasing their cytosolic calcium concentration (Cornell-Bell et al., 1990) and providing a feedback to neuron-neuron signaling by, for example: (1) secreting glutamate and activating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on pre-synaptic neurons (Perea and Araque, 2007) and/or (2) secreting D-serine and modulating N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) on post-synaptic neurons (Henneberger et al., 2010). Moreover, individual astrocytes are known to have fine processes that can enwrap asymmetrical (mainly excitatory) synapses (Fellin et al., 2006). Thus, strategically, astrocytes are ideally positioned to receive signal and relay it onto a small population of neurons during specific cognitive tasks. \n \nThe majority of experiments conducted so far have suggested that astrocytes contribute to short-term (Perea and Araque, 2007; Sibille et al., 2014, 2015) and long-term potentiation of individual synapses (Perea and Araque, 2007; Henneberger et al., 2010; Shigetomi et al., 2013). Several mathematical models have been developed (Nadkarni and Jung, 2007; Volman et al., 2007; De Pitta et al., 2009; Wade et al., 2011; Tewari and Majumdar, 2012b) to explore the tripartite synapse, a conventional neuron-neuron synapse with an add-on of a peri-synaptic astrocyte. However, relatively few experiments on hippocampal slices (Fellin et al., 2004; Sasaki et al., 2014) are available which report on the effect of astrocyte signaling on neuronal synchrony. These experiments hint at a role of astrocytes in tuning LFPs during events of memory acquisition and/or retrieval (see Table \u200bTable11 for a list of LFP rhythms and associated cognitive function). \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nList of different LFP types and their proposed behavioral function. \n \n \n \nAs stated earlier, there are several mathematical models which quantify the effect of astrocytes at a single synapse. However, there are not many mathematical models which attempt at integrating the effect of astrocytes on a network of synapses and possible LFP rhythm generation and its modulation. One such mathematical model was developed by Tewari and Parpura (2013) that simulated the effect of astrocyte signaling on neuronal synchrony and LFP generation using published biophysics-based models of neurons and astrocytes. Briefly, four CA1 pyramidal neurons (with recurrent synapses) were stimulated by a single CA3 pyramidal neuron with one astrocyte present in the stratum oriens wrapping the CA3-CA1 synapses. The mathematical model of pyramidal neurons was the branching dendrite model (Traub et al., 1991, 1994) and astrocyte wrappings were modeled using the tripartite synapse model (Tewari and Majumdar, 2012a,b). LFP computation of their small CA1 network suggested astrocyte-dependent delta oscillations (Tewari and Parpura, 2013). Otherwise, the modeled neuronal network exhibited a theta rhythm. It should be noted that CA3 pyramidal neuron firing is essential for a recall of memory related patterns (Makara and Magee, 2013). Therefore, recurrent CA3 pyramidal neuron activity may affect the rhythm of CA1 LFP during recall of memory related patterns. Of note, the sole existing model (Tewari and Parpura, 2013) did not account for these recurrent connections within CA3 pyramidal neurons. \n \nIt is interesting that a recent experimental study has also demonstrated that the ablation of astrocytic vesicular release leads to the impairment of cognitive abilities in awake mice (Lee et al., 2014). More specifically, Lee et al. (2014) observed astrocyte-dependent tuning of cortical neurons to gamma rhythm, a result which appears to be in contrast with the model predictions of Tewari and Parpura (2013). However, the differences can be reconciled by: (1) the presence of neocortical interneurons known to oscillate at gamma frequency (Bartos et al., 2007) and/or (2) the size of network used to compute field potentials. It is quite possible that different brain regions may have different firing patterns in response to a given task. An alternate explanation for this difference in LFP rhythm observed in the model (Tewari and Parpura, 2013) and data (Lee et al., 2014) can be merely due to the choice of parameters used in the modeling approach; e.g., number of concurrent CA1 synapses, density of extra-synaptic NMDAR current etc. \n \nTo summarize, it has now become quite clear, from experiments and modeling simulations, that astrocytes do play an important role in modulating mammalian cognitive and behavioral abilities. But whether their contribution is specific to certain cognitive tasks than others remains to be seen.

Capturing the common semantic characteristics between the visual modality and the class semantic modality (e.g., attributes or word vector) is a key to the success of ZSL. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder\u2013decoder approach, namely latent space encoding (LSE), to connect the semantic relations of different modalities. Instead of requiring a projection function to transfer information across different modalities like most previous work, LSE performs the interactions of different modalities via a feature aware latent space, which is learned in an implicit way. Specifically, different modalities are modeled separately but optimized jointly. For each modality, an encoder\u2013decoder framework is performed to learn a feature aware latent space via jointly maximizing the recoverability of the original space from the latent space and the predictability of the latent space from the original space. To relate different modalities together, their features referring to the same concept are enforced to share the same latent codings. In this way, the common semantic characteristics of different modalities are generalized with the latent representations. Another property of the proposed approach is that it is easily extended to more modalities. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets [animal with attribute, Caltech UCSD birds, aPY, and ImageNet] clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on several ZSL tasks, including traditional ZSL, generalized ZSL, and zero-shot retrieval."}, {"paperId": "00ca9786ea5353901cc3ca4f2ab3d9d51e32aba3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ca9786ea5353901cc3ca4f2ab3d9d51e32aba3", "title": "Comparison of Web Service Similarity- Assessment Methods", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.5120/17315-7630", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5120/17315-7630?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5120/17315-7630, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

More explicitly, if energy is attributed to words according to their frequency of appearance in a text, then the ensuing energy levels are distributed non-classically, namely, they obey Bose\u2013Einstein, rather than Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann, statistics, as a consequence of the genuinely \u2018quantum indistinguishability\u2019 of the words that appear in the text. Secondly, the \u2018quantum entanglement\u2019 due to the way meaning is carried by a text reduces the (von Neumann) entropy of the words that appear in the text, a behaviour which cannot be explained within classical (thermodynamic or information) entropy. We claim here that this \u2018quantum-type behaviour is valid in general in human language\u2019, namely, any text is conceptually more concrete than the words composing it, which entails that the entropy of the overall text decreases. In addition, we provide examples taken from cognition, where quantization of energy appears in categorical perception, and from culture, where entities collaborate, thus \u2018entangle\u2019, to decrease overall entropy. We use these findings to propose the development of a new \u2018non-classical thermodynamic theory\u2019 for human cognition, which also covers broad parts of human culture and its artefacts and bridges concepts with quantum physics entities.

Dewey"}], "abstract": "An Evaluation of Interspersing the Testing Effect During Lecture on Test Performance and Notes in High Schoolers Angela M. Dewey Testing is the most common way to assess student learning at all ages and grade levels. Testing is traditionally viewed as a measure of knowledge, and not as a way to enhance learning. Nonetheless, a large body of literature demonstrates that testing is actually an effective way to facilitate learning and enhance long-term memory for information. This finding, that retrieval of information from memory leads to better retention than re-studying or re-reading the same information, has been termed the testing effect. The benefit of testing compared to review of material is typically seen after a delay between practice and final test, with review being a better strategy when the test is given immediately or after a short delay. This phenomenon has been shown across a variety of contexts, test formats, retention intervals, and ranges of ages and abilities. However, one domain in which the testing effect has not been shown to work is in the review of student-produced lecture notes. Lecture note-taking is a ubiquitous learning strategy and notes have been shown to be highly correlated with academic outcomes such as test performance and GPA. Note-taking in itself is a cognitively demanding process, and students often struggle to take accurate and complete notes from lecture, thus limiting the benefits of note-taking and review. There is limited research on ways to improve the review function of notes. Thus, this dissertation sought to understand the effect of integrating the testing effect into the context of lecture note-taking on memory for information compared to review of notes and a lecture-only control. A sample of 59 high school students watched a video lecture and took notes on the information. The lecture was divided into three sections with two-minute pauses in between each segment. During each pause, students were asked to either reread their notes from the previous section (review group), recall and write down what they remembered to be the most important ideas from the lecture they were just shown (self-testing group), or complete a distractor word search puzzle for the duration of the pause (lecture-only control group). Participants were given a written recall test of lecture information following a one-day delay. Comparisons were made between lecture groups on test performance and note quantity. Measures of sustained attention and mind-wandering during lecture were examined as covariates. While participants in the self-testing group scored higher on the written recall test, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Self-testing and reviewing notes during lecture pauses were both significantly better than lecture note-taking alone. Results also showed that it was actually the students in the review group who took significantly more notes than those in the lecture-only control. There was a main effect for time, indicating that students in all lecture groups took increasingly more notes as the lecture progressed. Note quantity was found to be a significant predictor of test performance. Examination of attentional variables showed that students who reported lower instances of mind-wandering took significantly more notes and did significantly better on the recall test. Further, students in the self-testing group reported less of an increase in mind-wandering as the lecture progressed compared to those in the control group. Differences between the results of this study and other studies in the testing effect literature are hypothesized to be due several factors, including complexity of lecture information, encoding difficulties, and the presentation of new information at each self-testing time point.

One way to understand this seemingly surprising coincidence is that the analysis of vectorand matrix-valued randomized constructions plays an important role in both fields. An example is the realization that certain matrix-valued large deviation bounds can be employed to substantially simplify and generalize the analysis of low-rank matrix recovery schemes. In this workshop, the participants worked to identify and collaborate on further mathematical problems that are being researched in parallel by the two communities. Topics that have been discussed include \u2022 Tools for the analysis of vectorand matrix-valued randomized constructions and their application to phase retrieval problems \u2022 Conversely, tools for de-randomizing such protocols, based, e.g., on spherical designs. \u2022 Uncertainty relations, e.g., for the task of lower-bounding the number of measurements required for signal identification. \u2022 Time-frequency methods (known as phase-space methods in physics). \u2022 Matrixand tensor norms: computational tools, complexity, relaxations and their application to tensor recovery.

Among the participants there were, on the one hand, nine researchers focusing on mathematical signal processing, in particular on sparse recovery and related questions, and, on the other hand, seven mathematical physicists who have contributed to quantum information theory. The connection between these fields first started to arise with the works of David Gross, one of the workshop organizers, who demonstrated that certain problems in quantum information theory are closely related to problems in low-rank matrix recovery [1]. So tools developed in mathematical physics can help solve mathematical signal processing problems. Following up on his results, a collaboration between David Gross, his PhD student Richard K\u00fcng, also a workshop participant, and Felix Krahmer, another organizer, started [4], strengthening the connection between the fields. This collaboration laid the foundation for the mini-workshop. From their collaboration experience, they realized that one of the biggest obstacles to an intensified collaboration between the fields was the often quite different mathematical language and notation used in the two fields, it was decided that a substantial part of the workshop should be devoted to communicating to the respective other group the way of thinking and the terminology employed. Another substantial part was to be devoted to communicating the general research goals to find collaboration projects, and the third intended pillar was organized discussions in small groups. The workshop started by two introductory talks of about 90 minutes each by participants representing the sparse recovery community. Dustin Mixon gave a general overview of mathematical signal processing problems on a very broad level and Holger Rauhut continued by providing a more technical introduction to the methods currently used. The goal of these two talks was to communicate the type of problems arising in the signal processing community to those participants from quantum information theory who were experts on relevant methods while not having applied them to mathematical signal processing before. Reciprocating, Andreas Winter gave a similar 90 minute talk introducing the problems and mathematical methods at the center of quantum information theory. After these introductions, the workshop proceeded as follows: days were kicked off by a one hour talk requested the previous day. After that, the participants were divided into collections of small, mixed groups that started working on specific questions. Topics that received significant attention by those groups are as follows: Tight large-deviation bounds for sums of random matrices. This theory was essential to set up the connection between the two communities. Originally developed by A. Winter to treat quantum information problems, large-deviation bounds for sums of random matrices were introduced into the theory of sparse and lowrank recovery by D. Gross and later greatly refined at the hands of J. Tropp. Joel Tropp presented the state of the art and the most pressing problems as he Mini-Workshop: Mathematical Physics meets Sparse Recovery 1049 sees the theory. A concrete problem \u2013 removing a sometimes spurious logarithmic dimension factor in front of the generally exponentially small large deviation probability \u2013 created particular interest. While the problem was not solved during the workshop, collaborations have been initiated as a result. A conjectured \u201cmatrix arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.\u201d Recently, a noncommutative extension of the well-known arithmetic-geometric mean inequality for vectors was proposed by B. Recht and C. R\u00e9 [2], and this conjecture was communicated to the workshop participants by Felix Krahmer and Rachel Ward. Such an inequality is of interest in machine learning and signal processing as it would give theoretical justification to the observed effect that without-replacement sampling schemes outperform with-replacement sampling schemes in randomized sequential optimization algorithms. Although this inequality has been verified in certain special cases, neither a general proof nor a counter-example has been found. While the conjecture was not resolved during the workshop, Marius Junge made initial discoveries towards finding a counter-example to the conjecture using free probability and recent techniques he had devised for related matrix problems. The nascent theory of tensor recovery. After having treated sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, the signal analysis community has recently turned their attention to the theory of learning low-rank tensors from underdetermined measurements. Tensor problems likewise appear in quantum mechanics, where manybody wave functions are just elements in large tensor spaces. After extremely well-received talks by Y.-K. Liu about applications in natural language processing and by Z. Stojanac on recent ideas for tensor norm relaxations based on theta bodies, several discussions ensued. A mixed group tried to devise measurements that are incoherent w.r.t. all low-rank tensors \u2013 generalizing previous such constructions that the quantum community routinely uses for matrices. The prospect of proving results for completely symmetric tensors was discussed. V. Cevher introduced the physicists to dual smoothing techniques that might speed up numerical methods for computing tensor norms. There was an extensive discussion as to whether tests for quantum separability based on symmetric extensions could give rise to well-performing convex proxies for tensor rank. Phase space and time-frequency methods. Inspired by an earlier talk by G. Pfander on time-frquency analysis and sparse recovery, D. Gross presented unpublished work on phase space support-rank uncertainty relations and their role in proving lower bounds to low-rank matrix recovery problems. A collaboration between Gross and Pfander was initiated with the goal to generalize these results from discrete to continuous Gabor systems. Stability of PhaseLift. The ill-defined inverse problem of retrieving an unknown complex vector from \u201camplitude\u201d measurements \u2013 i.e. linear measurements that are ignorant towards complex phases \u2013 has received considerable attention in the field of mathematical signal processing over the last few years. Moreover, problems of this type are also of considerable interest for doing quantum state tomography \u2013 an important subfield of quantum information theory [5]. During the course of the workshop, H. Rauhut and R. K\u00fcng started to tackle the important problem 1050 Oberwolfach Report 18/2014 of proving stability guarantees for PhaseLift in the presence of noise for certain measurement setups \u2013 most notably random coded diffraction patterns [6]. Although the problem could not be fully solved during the workshop, partial results have been obtained and yet another ongoing collaboration (between H. Rauhut, R. K\u00fcng and D. Gross) arose. In this context, also a connection in the other direction arose, namely F. Krahmer and Y.-K. Liu started a collaboration with the goal to apply mathematical tools developed and applied in the context of phase retrieval problems to problems in quantum information. Statistical trade-offs in low-rank recovery. It had been observed numerically [5] that the performance of low-rank based estimators for quantum state tomography displays the following behavior: Assume the total number of experimental samples taken is constant. There is the freedom to use these samples to either estimate a few linear functions of the unknown low-rank matrix to a high precision, or many distinct functions more coarsely. Maybe surprisingly, it turns out that the performance of the estimator is largely independent of that choice. This is of relevance to physical experiments \u2013 but the physicists failed to find a theoretical explanation for this behavior. M. Gutta suggested an approach based on asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator, while R. Saab proposed to use results about the behavior of right-inverses of near-isometric embeddings to attack the problem. Both ideas seem promising, and a collaboration between the aforementioned researchers, D. Gross and A. Winter to further pursue these questions has been initiated. To conclude, this mini-workshop was by all accounts a great suc"}, {"paperId": "00cf73c90348b5c2f612e53e61833b8cb38373f6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00cf73c90348b5c2f612e53e61833b8cb38373f6", "title": "Pre-training Methods in Information Retrieval", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13853", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13853, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge model size, pre-trained models can learn universal language representations from massive textual data, which are beneficial to the ranking task of IR. Recently, a large number of works, which are dedicated to the application of PTMs in IR, have been introduced to promote the retrieval performance. Considering the rapid progress of this direction, this survey aims to provide a systematic review of pre-training methods in IR. To be specific, we present an overview of PTMs applied in different components of an IR system, including the retrieval component, the re-ranking component, and other components. In addition, we also introduce PTMs specifically designed for IR, and summarize available datasets as well as benchmark leaderboards.

Topicality was still considered the most important criteria for video relevance judgments, however, users also liked to see visual surrogates, especially those surrogates that contained motion. A more formal study is planned, and we expect that the results will not only enrich the relevance literature but also have implications for video indexing and retrieval research."}, {"paperId": "00d37670636629b5e61b37b846500fa3fe7d7a66", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00d37670636629b5e61b37b846500fa3fe7d7a66", "title": "XX.

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission measures global precipitation at a temporal resolution of a few hours to enable close monitoring of the global hydrological cycle. GPM achieves this by combining observations from a\nspaceborne precipitation radar, a constellation of passive microwave (PMW)\nsensors, and geostationary satellites. The Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF) is used operationally to retrieve precipitation from all PMW sensors of the GPM constellation. Since the resulting precipitation rates serve as input for many of the level\u00a03 retrieval products, GPROF constitutes an essential component of the GPM processing pipeline. This study investigates ways to improve GPROF using modern machine learning\nmethods. We present two neural-network-based, probabilistic implementations of GPROF: GPROF-NN 1D, which (just like the current GPROF implementation) processes pixels individually, and GPROF-NN 3D, which employs a convolutional neural network to incorporate structural information into the retrieval. The accuracy of the retrievals is evaluated using a test dataset consistent with the data used in the development of the GPROF and GPROF-NN retrievals. This allows for assessing the accuracy of the retrieval method isolated from the representativeness of the training data, which remains a major source of uncertainty in the development of precipitation retrievals. Despite using the same input information as GPROF, the GPROF-NN 1D retrieval improves the accuracy of the retrieved surface precipitation for the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) from 0.079 to 0.059\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121 in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), from 76.1\u2009% to 69.5\u2009% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE)\nand from 0.797 to 0.847 in terms of correlation. The improvements for the Microwave\nHumidity Sounder (MHS) are from 0.085 to 0.061\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121 in terms\nof MAE, from 81\u2009% to 70.1\u2009% for SMAPE, and from 0.724 to 0.804 in terms of correlation. Comparable improvements are\nfound for the retrieved hydrometeor profiles and their column integrals, as well\nas the detection of precipitation. Moreover, the ability of the retrievals to\nresolve small-scale variability is improved by more than 40\u2009% for\nGMI and 29\u2009% for MHS. The GPROF-NN 3D retrieval further improves\nthe MAE to 0.043\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121; the SMAPE to 48.67\u2009%;\nand the correlation to 0.897 for GMI and 0.043\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121,\n63.42\u2009%, and 0.83 for MHS. Application of the retrievals to GMI observations of Hurricane Harvey shows\nmoderate improvements when compared to co-located GPM-combined and ground-based radar measurements indicating that the improvements at least partially carry over to assessment against independent measurements. Similar retrievals for MHS do not show equally clear improvements, leaving the validation against independent measurements for future investigation. Both GPROF-NN algorithms make use of the same input and output data as the\noriginal GPROF algorithm and thus may replace the current implementation in a\nfuture update of the GPM processing pipeline. Despite their superior accuracy,\nthe single-core runtime required for the operational processing of an orbit of\nobservations is lower than that of GPROF. The GPROF-NN algorithms promise to be\na simple and cost-efficient way to increase the accuracy of the PMW\nprecipitation retrievals of the GPM constellation and thus improve the\nmonitoring of the global hydrological cycle.\n"}, {"paperId": "00d6544e1d0571dc31da417ca600a60c6e2fdbf5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00d6544e1d0571dc31da417ca600a60c6e2fdbf5", "title": "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jdmdh.episciences.org/18/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4617, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

An important issue of patent mining is that of recognizing the technologies contained in patents, which serves as a fundamental preparation for deeper analysis. To this end, in this article, we make a focused study on constructing a technology portrait for each patent, i.e., to recognize technical phrases concerned in it, which can summarize and represent patents from a technical perspective. Along this line, a critical challenge is how to analyze the unique characteristics of technical phrases and illustrate them with definite descriptions. Therefore, we first generate the detailed descriptions about the technical phrases existing in extensive patents based on different criteria, including various previous works, practical experience, and statistical analyses. Then, considering the unique characteristics of technical phrases and the complex structure of patent documents, such as multi-aspect semantics and multi-level relevances, we further propose a novel unsupervised model, namely TechPat, which can not only automatically recognize technical phrases from massive patents but also avoid the need for expensive human labeling. After that, we evaluate the extraction results from various aspects. Specifically, we propose a novel evaluation metric called Information Retrieval Efficiency (IRE) to quantify the performance of extracted technical phrases from a new perspective.

Accuracy and precision of laser altimetry measurements depend on the knowledge of spacecraft position and pointing and on the instrument. Both are important for the retrieval of tidal parameters. In order to assess the quality of the altimeter retrievals, we are training and implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) to identify and exclude scans from analysis which yield erroneous data. The implementation is based on the PyTorch framework [3]. We are presenting our results for the MESSENGER Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) data set [4], but also in view of future analysis of the BepiColombo Laser Altimeter (BELA) data, which will arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2025 on board the Mercury Planetary Orbiter [5,6]. We further explore conventional methods of error identification and compare these with the machine learning results. Short periods of large residuals or large variation of residuals are identified and used to detect erroneous measurements. Furthermore, long-period systematics, such as those caused by slow variations in instrument pointing, can be modelled by including additional parameters.<br>[1] Zuber, Maria T., David E.

However, most existing works follow a text-based video retrieval paradigm only, limited by two main drawbacks: (1) The episodic information presented in described events is not fully perceived, leading to declines in retrieval performance facing variable query intentions. (2) Current models are prone to returning false positive results with similar semantics, as simple text queries can hardly accurately describe the target video content users seek. In this paper, we propose a novel event retrieval framework termed Composed Query-Based Event Retrieval (CQBER). Specifically, we first construct two CQBER benchmark datasets, namely ActivityNet-CQ and TVR-CQ, which cover TV shows and open-world scenarios, respectively. Additionally, we propose an initial CQBER method, termed Multimodal Episodic Perceptron (MEP), which excavates complete query semantics from both observed static visual cues and various descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly boosts event retrieval accuracy across different existing methods.

The sample in this study amounted to 105 graduates who returned the instrument. The results showed, First, the profile of Graduate PS IPK UNP was dominated by female graduates. Most of the graduates are graduates who graduated in 2018. Judging from the length of the study period, the average graduate has a length of the study period of 3 years. Second, the absorption of graduates in the workforce is quite high, with most graduates stating that they are currently working with the time needed to get the job <3 months. Third, the use of knowledge obtained by a graduate at the PS IPK UNP in employment is very high. The science that has a very high level of wear is fieldwork learning, technology mastery skills, and the ability to cooperate in teams. Fourth, the assessment of graduate users (stakeholders) on the ability to graduate in the work world has also been good. The ability of the graduate to be considered good by graduate users (stakeholders) is integrity, expertise based on the fields of science, mastery of information technology, and teamwork.Keywords: Information retrieval, graduate, tracer study"}, {"paperId": "00db3b4674ce4533fab48f8292fd3e42a2f3254f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00db3b4674ce4533fab48f8292fd3e42a2f3254f", "title": "Measurement of low\u2010altitude CO over the Indian subcontinent by MOPITT", "year": 2008, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1029/2007jd009362", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1029/2007JD009362?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JD009362, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We find that MOPITT retrievals at 850 hPa show localized enhancements over the Indian subcontinent, which correlate with similar enhancements seen in the tropospheric NO2 columns from the SCIAMACHY instrument. In particular, high concentrations of CO over the Indo-Gangetic basin and some prominent cities are captured in the lower-tropospheric retrievals in spring. MOPITT averaging kernels (normalized to take into account the absorber amounts in the layers) indicate that the retrievals are sensitive to CO in the lower troposphere. In winter, MOPITT retrievals at 850 hPa can detect the strongest source areas over the eastern states of Bihar and West Bengal, thus confirming the so-called \u201cBihar pollution pool,\u201d which was detected earlier in the aerosol measurements by the multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard Terra. The pollution features are consistent with the spatial distribution of CO emissions in India, as reflected in the GEOS-Chem simulation of CO. Furthermore, these lower-tropospheric features in the simulation are still present after smoothing the modeled fields using the MOPITT averaging kernels and a priori profile, demonstrating that the retrievals do have sensitivity in the lower troposphere. This work indicates that although MOPITT retrievals are often most sensitive to CO in the middle and upper troposphere, they do provide information on lower-tropospheric CO in selected continental regions with strong thermal contrast and could be useful for pollution studies."}, {"paperId": "00db8e68874d53d9a0608fe29671fbdef4113067", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00db8e68874d53d9a0608fe29671fbdef4113067", "title": "ESHRE Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis Consortium: data collection III (May 2001).", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-pdf/17/1/233/9817262/170233.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/humrep/17.1.233?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/17.1.233, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Here, the third report of the ESHRE PGD Consortium is presented, collating data received from 25 centres on referrals, cycles, pregnancies and babies born after PGD. The second report, published in December 2000, reported on 886 referrals, a total of 1318 started cycles (of which 465 for aneuploidy screening, 386 for fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and 385 for PCR going beyond oocyte retrieval), 163 pregnancies and 162 children born. This year, 675 referrals from 12 centres were added giving a total of 1561 referrals, 370 regular PGD cycles, 334 PGD-aneuploidy screening (PGD-AS) cycles and 78 cycles for social sexing from 24 centres and 215 pregnancies and 117 babies from 12 centres. Because more in-depth information was asked for the cycles, this year's data will be shown separately as well as cumulatively. One striking feature of this year's data collection is the appearance of the first data for gender screening on preimplantation embryos for social reasons. The ethical concerns regarding social sexing will be discussed, as well as the forthcoming changes in timing of data collection. When the data collection was discussed at the last meeting of the members of the ESHRE PGD Consortium in Lausanne, Switzerland (June, 2001), it appeared that the current system of data collection, although yielding results very quickly, showed fundamental flaws. The ESHRE PGD Consortium Steering Committee intends to remedy to these problems, on the one hand by introducing a new type and timing of data collection, and on the other hand by re-analysing and correcting the data which have already been sent in during the past 4 years."}, {"paperId": "00dbc8410aeda43ee7ff9e25d1241f6013dd0b11", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00dbc8410aeda43ee7ff9e25d1241f6013dd0b11", "title": "Different tools for handling Geographic Information Retrieval problems", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ewic.bcs.org/content/ConMediaFile/26479", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14236/EWIC/FDIA2015.16?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14236/EWIC/FDIA2015.16, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Artificial intelligence has been widely applied to water depth retrieval across various environments, deemed essential for habitat modeling, hydraulic structure design, and watershed management. However, most of these models have been developed for deep waters, with the critical impact of the gradient descent algorithm often not evaluated. To address this gap in current research, this study adopted the artificial neural network with seven gradient descent methods, including step, momentum, quick propagation, delta-bar-delta, conjugate gradient, Levenberg\u2013Marquardt, and resilient backpropagation (RProp), for shallow water depth modeling. Shallow water depths in Taiwan\u2019s mountainous rivers were then modeled using multispectral imagery taken by drone and vegetation indices. From our results, it was revealed that methods optimizing weight updates were outperformed by those based on gradient information, such as RProp. The selection of gradient descent algorithm was identified as pivotal; an inappropriate selection might even result in performance inferior to a traditional linear regression model. In the sensitivity analysis, near-infrared and normalized difference water index were classified as highly sensitive. By leveraging multispectral data and vegetation indices with ANN, the optimal gradient descent algorithm and the critical model input for shallow water modeling were successfully identified, offering invaluable insights for future studies."}, {"paperId": "00dc01b567d8271bca91fac4bae0f136e7261faa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00dc01b567d8271bca91fac4bae0f136e7261faa", "title": "Building Tag-Aware Groups for Music High-Order Ranking and Topic Discovery", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://delab.csd.auth.gr/papers/IJMDEMrnm.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4018/jmdem.2010070101?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4018/jmdem.2010070101, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The tool uses two steps for generating test cases. First, the system\u2019s requirements are transformed into a use-case diagram. Second, the use cases are then used to automatically generate the test cases. The tool allows a user to layout the requirements of a system via a use-case diagram in the workspace provided. In the workspace, a ToolBox is used to create, edit and display the use-case diagram. The ToolBox consists of standard symbols and arrows for a use-case diagram such as symbols for an actor and a use case, and arrows for connecting an actor with use cases as well as arrows for extends and uses. The workspace also allows a user to type-in the text for each of the use cases used. Once the use-case diagram has been finalized, it can be saved and edited at any other time. The engine of the tool will take all the use cases from the use-case diagram and search the keywords used in the provided database.

In this paper we show how Web page status may be predicted at least in part by page location and topic specificity. Moreover, we observe that the \u201cphilanthropic\u201d contributions of a Web page---specifically, contributions of information brokerage function---are also good predictors of in-links. The observations are made in the presence of domain-and topic-specific effects. Interestingly, all of these features that may predict status are \u201clocal\u201d to a given Web page and within the control of the owner/author of the page. This is in contrast to the \u201cglobal\u201d nature of Web linkage-based metrics such as in-link count that are derived as a result of downloading and indexing billions of pages.

However, current models heavily rely on ground-truth information, hindering the application of quantization in label-hungry scenarios. A more realistic demand is to learn from inexhaustible uploaded images that are associated with informal tags provided by amateur users. Though such sketchy tags do not obviously reveal the labels, they actually contain useful semantic information for supervising deep quantization. To this end, we propose Weakly-Supervised Deep Hyperspherical Quantization (WSDHQ), which is the first work to learn deep quantization from weakly tagged images. Specifically, 1) we use word embeddings to represent the tags and enhance their semantic information based on a tag correlation graph. 2) To better preserve semantic information in quantization codes and reduce quantization error, we jointly learn semantics-preserving embeddings and supervised quantizer on hypersphere by employing a well-designed fusion layer and tailor-made loss functions. Extensive experiments show that WSDHQ can achieve state-of-art performance in weakly-supervised compact coding."}, {"paperId": "00e429feeef2053c1f6ee77c2a9065bee28328b3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e429feeef2053c1f6ee77c2a9065bee28328b3", "title": "Human motion capture data retrieval based on semantic thumbnail", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In Experiment 2, for the encoding condition, participants were asked to classify word and picture label onset (i.e., first letter) as a consonant or a vowel as quickly as possible. Recall for Experiment 1 replicated the picture superiority effect; however, the concreteness effect failed to materialize. The results for Experiment 2 again replicated the picture superiority effect. Unlike in Experiment 1, the concreteness effect was obtained.

LIBO ZHAO, STEPHANIE PACKARD, & PRAHLAD GUPTA, University of Iowa (sponsored by Prahlad Gupta)\u2014Learning of a word involves learning of a phonological word form, its meaning (or referent), and the mapping between them. We examined the effect of referent similarity on word learning. Experiment 1 found that word-learning performance, as measured by naming accuracy, was lowest for the highsimilarity condition (highly similar referents used), highest for the lowsimilarity condition (dissimilar referents used), and in between for the medium-similarity condition (moderately similar referents used). Importantly, the naming errors in the high-similarity and medium-similarity conditions were mostly due to confusions in mapping between the word forms and the referents. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that prior discrimination experiences between the highly similar referents led to improvement in word learning, eliminating the detrimental effect of referent similarity. These findings suggest that mapping a word form to a referent that is similar to others involves identifying information in that referent that distinguishes it from the others. (1020) Effects of Exogenous Spatial Cuing on Repetition Priming Depends on Stimulus Size. YOUSRI MARZOUKI, University of Provence and CNRS\u2014An experiment combined exogenous spatial cuing with masked repetition priming. Participants performed a lexical decision task (word vs. pseudoword classification) with central targets and horizontal peripheral primes that were cued or not by an exogenous abrupt onset. In the present study, word length was manipulated (three-letter words vs. fiveletter words). The results showed a significant facilitation of prime processing by an exogenous valid cue only with three-letter words, whereas with five-letter words, an inhibitory effect was observed. These data indicate that an exogenous spatial cue boosts the prime at the location of the cue, explaining the higher gain for repetition-priming effects. This gain cannot be obtained with longer peripheral primes, which indicates the crucial role that the physical size of the parafoveal stimulus plays in priming efficiently a centrally located target. (1021) Assessing the Influence of Letter Position in Reading Connected Texts Using a Letter Detection Task. JEAN SAINT-AUBIN & KATHERINE GU\u00c9RARD, University of Moncton, & MARIE POIRIER & CONSTANTINA DEMETRIOU, City University London\u2014One of the most basic processes involved in reading continuous texts is the recognition of the words\u2019 constituent letters. Although some studies have suggested that the initial and final letters of a word have a privileged status, there is no consensus with regard to the time course of letter recognition and to the importance of the different letter positions when connected texts are read. In the present experiments, we used a letter search task to examine the impact of letter position on word identification in connected text, using the classical paper-and-pencil procedure (Experiment 1) and an eye-movement-monitoring procedure (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, a condition with transposed letters was included. Our results show that the first letter\u2014but not the last letter\u2014of words benefits from better processing and that an advantage for the final letter occurs when the visual configuration of words is altered. (1022) The Scope of Meaning Activation During Lexical Ambiguity Resolution in the Cerebral Hemispheres. HOANG VU & MICHAEL HAJI, Saint Mary\u2019s College, & GEORGE KELLAS, University of Kansas\u2014 The present research examined the scope of meaning activation in the cerebral hemispheres following the central presentation of sentences that were biased toward the subordinate meaning of an ambiguous word. Immediately (0-msec ISI) after each sentence was presented, a target word was presented to either the left or the right visual field to await a lexical decision. Target words were related to either the dominant or the subordinate meaning of the lexical ambiguity, and each target word was either highly salient to the expressed meaning or less salient. Lexical decision times showed that in the left hemisphere (LH), only target words related to the subordinate meaning of the subordinate biased sentences were activated regardless of salience; however, high-salient target words were activated to a greater degree than low-salient targets. In contrast, in the right hemisphere (RH), lexical decision times showed a more complicated pattern of activation. Targets related to both dominant and subordinate meanings were activated, with different magnitudes of activation for highand low-salient targets. The results are discussed within Beeman\u2019s (1998) proposal of fine semantic coding in the LH and coarse coding in the RH. (1023) The Role of Subsyllabic Units in Visual Word Processing of Korean Monosyllabic Words: A Masked Priming Study. SAY YOUNG KIM & DONALD J. BOLGER, University of Maryland, College Park (sponsored by Carol Whitney)\u2014A putative left-branching syllable structure has been proposed for Korean (i.e., body\u2013coda) in contrast to English (i.e., right-branching), on the basis of such tasks as sound similarity judgments (e.g., Yoon, Bolger, Kwon, & Perfetti, 2001). The present study examined whether or not Korean speakers favor a body\u2013coda structure over an onset\u2013rime structure within a monosyllabic word during a masked prime lexical decision task (SOA = 47 msec). Korean participants were given CVC structured monosyllabic words as targets, preceded by one of four different types of primes: body (CV_), rime (_VC), identical (CVC), and nonmatch as control. The main effect of prime type was significant. Identical primes induced the largest facilitation effect on the targets, but it was not different from that of body primes. The lack of a priming effect with the rime unit supports the proposed body unit (leftbranching) preference in the nonlinear orthographic syllable package (kulja) of Korean. (1024) The Development of Italian Pseudohomophone Reading. FRANCESCA PERESSOTTI & LUCIA COLOMBO, University of Padua\u2014 Italian pseudohomophones (storya) are read faster than orthographically matched nonwords (stofya) because they benefit from activation of phonological units in the lexicon. They show no advantage as compared with unmatched nonwords (stofia; Peressotti & Colombo, 2008), since the latter receive activation from the orthographic lexicon. Due to their unusual spelling, pseudohomophones do not benefit from lexical orthographic activation, since they can be read only via phonological recoding. In the present study, we investigated the development of these effects. First-, second-, and third-grade children were presented pseudohomophones, matched nonwords, and unmatched control nonwords in a mixed list. Accuracy and RTs were measured. The results are discussed in light of the development of relative contribution of lexical and sublexical knowledge, on the one hand, and orthographical versus phonological information, on the other hand. (1025) Orthography and Morphology in the Recognition of Compound Words. UN-SO PARK-DIENER & GREG B. SIMPSON, University of Kansas\u2014Rastle (2004) used a masked-priming visual lexical decision task in three different priming conditions and found priming when the prime and the target had a morphological relationship (e.g., cleaner\u2013 clean) and also when the prime and the target only looked as if they had a morphological relationship (e.g., corner\u2013corn), but not when the prime and target shared only the form, such as in brothel\u2013broth. This result suggests that people decompose words by their morphological structure. In the present study, we used a similar design with words composed of free morphemes. We also used three types of priming conditions: actual compound words (doghouse\u2013dog), pseudocompound words (mushroom\u2013mush), and orthographic controls (spinach\u2013spin). Reaction time results showed priming in the compound word condition, but not in the pseudocompound word condition. Apparent morphological relationship may not be enough for decomposing compound words. \u2022  PsychoLinguistics  \u2022 (1026) Behavioral Correlates of \u201cDeep\u201d and \u201cSurface\u201d Anaphora. REBECCA R. WOODBURY, Harvard University and MIT, & DAVID N. CAPLAN, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University (sponsored by David N. Caplan)\u2014Two self-paced reading time experiments were conducted using two sets of materials that differed in whether they contained a \u201csurface\u201d or a \u201cdeep\u201d anaphor. \u201cDistance\u201d materials were used to examine the effect of placing an intervening sentence between the antecedent and anaphor, and \u201cparticle shift\u201d materials were used to examine the effect of repeated matching or mismatching word order following the antecedent and anaphor. For distance materials, no difference in reading time at the anaphoric region was found between short and long conditions for either surface or deep anaphors, but comprehension question accuracy was lower and comprehension question response time was higher in long conditions than in shor"}, {"paperId": "00e6fc5af6a150e9e2f04bfad06823f6003295b3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e6fc5af6a150e9e2f04bfad06823f6003295b3", "title": "Reasoning with Conceptual Distance in an Information Retrieval Model", "year": 1990, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52080112", "name": "\uae40\uc601\ud658"}, {"authorId": "2152677587", "name": "Jin H.

Typical RAG approaches split the text database into chunks, organizing them in a flat structure for efficient searches. To better capture the inherent dependencies and structured relationships across the text database, researchers propose to organize textual information into an indexing graph, known asgraph-based RAG. However, we argue that the limitation of current graph-based RAG methods lies in the redundancy of the retrieved information, rather than its insufficiency. Moreover, previous methods use a flat structure to organize retrieved information within the prompts, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose PathRAG, which retrieves key relational paths from the indexing graph, and converts these paths into textual form for prompting LLMs. Specifically, PathRAG effectively reduces redundant information with flow-based pruning, while guiding LLMs to generate more logical and coherent responses with path-based prompting. Experimental results show that PathRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six datasets and five evaluation dimensions.

AI-enhanced knowledge management (KM) systems are revolutionizing how organizations capture, organize, access, and leverage their collective intelligence assets. Traditional KM systems have long struggled with information silos, manual curation bottlenecks, and inefficient search capabilities, resulting in significant productivity losses. AI technologies, including natural language processing, machine learning, and generative AI, address these challenges by enabling intelligent automation, enhanced discovery, and dynamic knowledge representation. The article examines core AI technologies powering modern KM systems, including semantic analysis, entity recognition, clustering algorithms, recommendation systems, and content generation capabilities. It further explores architectural components such as vector databases, retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, and multimodal processing capabilities that form the foundation of effective AI-enhanced knowledge systems. Implementation considerations, including data quality governance, enterprise system integration, and change management strategies, are discussed in detail. Through comprehensive examination of research across multiple domains, this article provides a holistic overview of how AI-enhanced knowledge management systems are fundamentally transforming organizational intelligence capabilities and delivering substantial competitive advantages in today's data-driven business landscape."}, {"paperId": "00e93fe5af7bb8cd8efd8c7a6fbefba1d8a89618", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e93fe5af7bb8cd8efd8c7a6fbefba1d8a89618", "title": "A Trace Metals, Radiobiology, and Cancer Information Retrieval System (Tracirs)", "year": 1965, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In addition, it quantifies their degree of complementarity, and as such the added value of an integrated information system. Finally, it includes a qualitative evaluation of the feasibility of combining alien species information from existing databases at EU level. Our comparative analysis of occurrence data across 30 online databases with alien species records uncovers a high degree of complementarity of information. The most comprehensive resource for country level alien species occurrences in Europe (DAISIE) fails to report about one out of every four species known to be alien to one or more countries within the EU27 + Norway territory. When accessing only a single database, a minimum of 10,000 species by country records stay unaccounted for at European level. The distributed and largely independent nature of existing alien species information systems has multiple consequences: (i) In the absence of an overarching data exploration system, it complicates the retrieval of information, and the identification of knowledge gaps; (ii) It allows systems to diverge and as such become less compatible; (iii) It potentially makes inefficient use of existing financial and intellectual resources. The efficiency and accuracy of existing databases could be improved if communication between systems was enhanced. Expert knowledge could be shared and harmonization of the information would facilitate the retrieval of information, for example through a common network of interoperable web services. Integrated alien species databases currently report occurrences at country level, with limited value for scientists and managers. A shift towards georeferenced occurrences could be achieved in a cost-effective way by link linking to biodiversity databases and digitized archives of relevant journals."}, {"paperId": "00ea6408abab612f2166ab91e4628dbfbad71a7f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ea6408abab612f2166ab91e4628dbfbad71a7f", "title": "Cluster analysis for hypertext systems", "year": 1993, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/160688.160704", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

As for episodic memory, engram cells have been proposed to explain the encoding and transformation of episodic memory. Another universe theory about memory is the cognitive map theory. Here I use cognitive map theory as the bridge to overcome the gap between spatial and episodic memory. I believe spatial memory is a highly compressed case of episodic memory. In addition, I propose the hypothesis that engram can trigger sharp-wave ripples. I use a spike neural network-based computational model to verify this hypothesis.

The purpose of this paper is to present an annotated dataset of 380 user-generated videos (UGVs), 200 debunked and 180 verified, along with 5,195 near-duplicate reposted versions of them, and a set of automatic verification experiments aimed to serve as a baseline for future comparisons.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe dataset was formed using a systematic process combining text search and near-duplicate video retrieval, followed by manual annotation using a set of journalism-inspired guidelines. Following the formation of the dataset, the automatic verification step was carried out using machine learning over a set of well-established features.\n\n\nFindings\nAnalysis of the dataset shows distinctive patterns in the spread of verified vs debunked videos, and the application of state-of-the-art machine learning models shows that the dataset poses a particularly challenging problem to automatic methods.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nPractical limitations constrained the current collection to three platforms: YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, there exists a wealth of information that can be drawn from the dataset analysis, which goes beyond the constraints of a single paper. Extension to other platforms and further analysis will be the object of subsequent research.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe dataset analysis indicates directions for future automatic video verification algorithms, and the dataset itself provides a challenging benchmark.\n\n\nSocial implications\nHaving a carefully collected and labelled dataset of debunked and verified videos is an important resource both for developing effective disinformation-countering tools and for supporting media literacy activities.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nBesides its importance as a unique benchmark for research in automatic verification, the analysis also allows a glimpse into the dissemination patterns of UGC, and possible telltale differences between fake and real content.\n"}, {"paperId": "00ee155a52263e225ede8c386a049a7eb6209110", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ee155a52263e225ede8c386a049a7eb6209110", "title": "Research on the Toponym Matched Query Based on the Semantic Type Ontology", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "115804996", "name": "Chengzhen Jia"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "00ee3e8482bcc13bf0603d543cbc0dc478eb66aa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ee3e8482bcc13bf0603d543cbc0dc478eb66aa", "title": "Utilizing Concept Maps to Improve Human-Agent Collaboration Within a Recognition-Primed Decision Model", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In this study, the Raman-scattering correction was considered in an analytical\n forward model, and the corresponding Raman excitation OLCI band centers were calculated. The coefficients and exponents for the power law model of phytoplankton absorption were determined by a neural network classifier using a combination of sun elevation, photosynthetically active radiation,\n and remote sensing reflectance at OLCI bands (413, 443, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665, and 683 nm). Two optimizations were executed. The shape of the colored detrital matter (CDM) spectrum was allowed to change during the second optimization. Based on comparisons of the phytoplankton absorption\n coefficients at 443 nm (a \u03a6[443]) predicted by the improved inversion with field measurements taken from cruise surveys of the Pearl River estuary and Daya Bay and the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System dataset and NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset,\n the modified inversion procedure could provide a good performance (r 2 = 0.86). The results showed that the contribution of Raman scattering to the remote sensing reflectance at 665 nm exceeded 22% in the open ocean. Moreover, the residual from the first optimization was\n compared with that from the second optimization, demonstrating that the variable CDM spectral slope in the analytical forward model could improve the accuracy of the forward model."}, {"paperId": "00f2306b6c59f07b79f56f8faa3565bae068feb9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f2306b6c59f07b79f56f8faa3565bae068feb9", "title": "Fuzzy concepts and information retrieval", "year": 1976, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102525357", "name": "H.

However, the relationship between cross-modality samples has rarely been mined. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modality Interaction and Alignment (CIA) module to solve the discrepancy problem. Through transforming the information between different modalities, the module guides the network to capture the modality-shared feature, which is beneficial to address the cross-modality discrepancy. Meanwhile, to better supervise the network, an enhanced contrastive loss is introduced. Contributed by the further optimization in the distance between intra-class samples, the network gains more effective supervision.

Once a thing is done they want to go on to the next, and if what they have created has passed out of their possession, they may have only the most fragmentary information about it. Now and then a painter like Edvard Munch will cling to his drawings and canvases with an archivist's determination, but as a rule studios seldom produce complete and orderly information. Architects are a different breed. As they have to cope with plumbers and building inspectors, they keep their drawings and specifications in orderly files, for future reference. But these take up a considerable amount of space, and when an architect retires or dies, all this magnificent record too often goes to the dump. Some sketchbooks or photographs may be kept by the architect's family, but the great mass of correspondence, specifications, and plans normally disappears beyond retrieval. Performers of music are temperamental people, more likely to give their names to some favorite form of spaghetti or peaches than to worry about recordkeeping, whereas producers and managers of theatres and opera houses are more concerned with staving off bankruptcy than with preserving sources for the future historian. In this issue of the American Archivist Mary Ellis Peltz describes the chaos that existed in the Metropolitan Opera before she and a group of volunteers undertook to transform chaos into archives.

To address the limited availability of paired non-speech audio-text data, learning methods for transferring the knowledge acquired from a large amount of paired audio-image data to shared audio-text representation have been investigated, suggesting the importance of how audio-image co-occurrence is learned. Conventional approaches in audio-image learning assign a single image randomly selected from the corresponding video stream to the entire audio clip, assuming their co-occurrence. However, this method may not accurately capture the temporal agreement between the target audio and image because a single image can only represent a snapshot of a scene, though the target audio changes from moment to moment. To address this problem, we propose two methods for audio and image matching that effectively capture the temporal information: (i) Nearest Match wherein an image is selected from multiple time frames based on similarity with audio, and (ii) Multiframe Match wherein audio and image pairs of multiple time frames are used. Experimental results show that method (i) improves the audio-text retrieval performance by selecting the nearest image that aligns with the audio information and transferring the learned knowledge. Conversely, method (ii) improves the performance of audio-image retrieval while not showing significant improvements in audio-text retrieval performance. These results indicate that refining audio-image temporal agreement may contribute to better knowledge transfer to audio-text retrieval."}, {"paperId": "00f614112efe5b759c7e16974ef931228505551b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f614112efe5b759c7e16974ef931228505551b", "title": "Research on Hybrid Index Method of Double-Layer B+ Tree for Power Big Data Considering Knowledge Graph", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1771/1/012004", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1771/1/012004?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1771/1/012004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A small number of recent studies suggests that number comparison is possibly one of the abilities that remain unaltered across the life span. We investigated the ability to compare single-digit numbers in young (19\u201339 years; n = 39) and healthy older (65\u201379 years; n = 39) adults in considerable detail, analyzing accuracy as well as mean and variance of their response time, together with several other well-established hallmarks of numerical comparison. Using a recent comprehensive process model that parsimoniously accounts quantitatively for many aspects of number comparison (Reike & Schwarz, 2016), we address two fundamental problems in the comparison of older to young adults in numerical comparison tasks: (a) to adequately correct speed measures for different levels of accuracy (older participants were significantly more accurate than young participants), and (b) to distinguish between general sensory and motor slowing on the one hand, as opposed to a specific age-related decline in the efficiency to retrieve and compare numerical magnitude representations. Our results represent strong evidence that healthy older adults compare magnitudes as efficiently as young adults, when the measure of efficiency is uncontaminated by strategic speed\u2013accuracy trade-offs and by sensory and motor stages that are not related to numerical comparison per se. At the same time, older adults aim at a significantly higher accuracy level (risk aversion), which necessarily prolongs processing time, and they also show the well-documented general decline in sensory and/or motor functions."}, {"paperId": "00f69bf5918d99f8f968147e2447859ff213754a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f69bf5918d99f8f968147e2447859ff213754a", "title": "Information Superiority via Formal Concept Analysis", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Large amounts of information are processed in such situations, and any particular detail could become important later, so performance is facilitated by maintaining long-term memory access to as much detail as possible. Precise analysis of such memory is difficult to achieve with experimentation or observation alone, so computational simulation is used as the analytical method. A computational process model grounded in cognitive theory (Soar) is constructed to fit extensive fine-grained behavioral data from an expert programmer. The model's structures and processes are then inspected for insights into NTM. Structurally, the model's NTM consists of fine-grain perceptual, semantic, and episodic items whose availability is tied to cues from the encoding context. Quantitatively, much more detail enters NTM than is ever retrieved, but when retrieval does occur it can change the course of behavior. To illustrate applications of the construct, the model is used to examine how a cluttered interface might impose cognitive costs by increasing retrieval demands on memory."}, {"paperId": "00f73c1ba3a423003b6ff7e14fca7a7ee7cfc2ed", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f73c1ba3a423003b6ff7e14fca7a7ee7cfc2ed", "title": "Orientation determination for 3D single molecule diffraction imaging", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Soil moisture (SM) measurements contain information about both pre-storm hydrologic states and within-storm rainfall estimates, both are essential for accurate streamflow simulation. In this study, an existing dual state/rainfall correction system is extended and implemented in a large basin with a semi-distributed land surface model. The latest Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite surface SM retrievals are assimilated to simultaneously correct antecedent SM states in the model and rainfall estimates from the latest Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. While the GPM rainfall is corrected slightly to moderately, especially for larger events, the correction is smaller than that reported in past studies because of the improved baseline quality of the new GPM satellite product. The streamflow is corrected slightly to moderately via dual correction across 8 Arkansas-Red sub-basins. The correction is larger at sub-basins with poorer GPM rainfall and poorer open-loop streamflow simulations. Overall, although the dual data assimilation scheme is able to nudge streamflow simulations in the correct direction, it corrects only a relatively small portion of the total streamflow error. Systematic modeling error accounts for a larger portion of the overall streamflow error, which is uncorrectable by standard data assimilation techniques. These findings suggest that we may be reaching a point of diminishing returns for applying data assimilation approaches to correct random errors in streamflow simulations. More substantial streamflow correction would rely on future research efforts aimed at reducing the systematic error and developing higher-quality satellite rainfall products.\n"}, {"paperId": "00fbddf9bf94fd6a268482e0ea2ca1d9f78083af", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00fbddf9bf94fd6a268482e0ea2ca1d9f78083af", "title": "Heterogeneity-Aware Local Binary Patterns for Retrieval of Histopathology Images", "year": 2019, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08633818.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897281?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897281, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Using retrieval systems to locate similar images when a query image is given can assist pathologists in making more reliable decisions when diagnosing, based on accurately diagnosed past cases.

However, using LBP on histopathology images is still under investigation from different perspectives. The immense texture variability of these images and the lack of labeled training data are among the challenges that must be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new extension of LBP that is explicitly aware of the heterogeneity of local texture patterns through heterogeneity-based weighting. We use both homogeneity and the second moment (variance) of local neighborhoods to extend LBP histograms with heterogeneity information so that they better capture the polymorphism in histopathology images. We applied all concepts at multiple scales and investigated the extensions through both separated and concatenated extended histograms. We applied the proposed method on three publicly available datasets, namely, KimiaPath24, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and BreakHis. The experimental results revealed that our features could retrieve and classify images with the highest accuracy. For KimiaPath24, we achieved 96.4% surpassing both LBP (91.0%) and deep features from VGG network (79.5%). For IDC, we reached the highest  $F1$  measure (0.7665).

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses data, collected globally for billing and epidemiological purposes, represents a valuable source of structured information. However, ICD coding is a challenging task. While numerous previous studies reported promising results in automatic ICD classification, they often describe input data specific model architectures, that are heterogeneously evaluated with different performance metrics and ICD code subsets. This study aims to explore the evaluation and construction of more effective Computer Assisted Coding (CAC) systems using generic approaches, focusing on the use of ICD hierarchy, medication data and a feed forward neural network architecture. Methods: We conduct comprehensive experiments using the MIMIC-III clinical database, mapped to the OMOP data model. Our evaluations encompass various performance metrics, alongside investigations into multitask, hierarchical, and imbalanced learning for neural networks. Results: We introduce a novel metric, RE@R, tailored to the ICD coding task, which offers interpretable insights for healthcare informatics practitioners, aiding them in assessing the quality of assisted coding systems. Our findings highlight that selectively cherry-picking ICD codes diminish retrieval performance without performance improvement over the selected subset. We show that optimizing for metrics such as NDCG and AUPRC outperforms traditional F1-based metrics in ranking performance. We observe that Neural Network training on different ICD levels simultaneously offers minor benefits for ranking and significant runtime gains. However, our models do not derive benefits from hierarchical or class imbalance correction techniques for ICD code retrieval. Conclusion: This study offers valuable insights for researchers and healthcare practitioners interested in developing and evaluating CAC systems. Using a straightforward sequential neural network model, we confirm that medical prescriptions are a rich data source for CAC systems, providing competitive retrieval capabilities for a fraction of the computational load compared to text-based models. Our study underscores the importance of metric selection and challenges existing practices related to ICD code sub-setting for model training and evaluation."}, {"paperId": "00fcd279bc6e702cfa72bf98c381242b25fd1734", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00fcd279bc6e702cfa72bf98c381242b25fd1734", "title": "Collection and Exploration of Large Data Monitoring Sets Using Bitmap Databases", "year": 2010, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://luca.ntop.org/Fastbit.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The mathematical abilities of a cohort of 75 children referred to the UCSF Dyslexia Center with a diagnosis of dyslexia, along with 18 typically developing controls aged 7 to 16, were initially evaluated using a behavioral neurology approach. A team of professional clinicians classified the 75 children with dyslexia into five groups, based on parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 reported symptoms and clinical history. These groups included children with no mathematical deficits and children with mathematical deficits in number processing, arithmetical procedures, arithmetic facts retrieval, or geometrical abilities. Subsequently, the children underwent evaluation using the MCB to determine concordance with the clinicians\u2019 impressions. Additionally, neuropsychological and cognitive standardized tests were administered. Our study reveals that within a cohort of children with dyslexia, 66% exhibit mathematical deficits, and among those with mathematical deficits, there is heterogeneity in the nature of these deficits. If these findings are confirmed in larger samples, they can potentially pave the way for new diagnostic approaches, consistent subtype classification, and, ultimately personalized interventions."}, {"paperId": "00fd3097e4231dc69d020074beb3157688fd136b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00fd3097e4231dc69d020074beb3157688fd136b", "title": "BASIN MANAGEMENT IN THE SAN BERNARDINO BASIN AREA", "year": 1980, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1980.tb03657.x?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1980.tb03657.x, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Specifically, what is its quantity, distribution, quality, what stresses will the water supply be subjected to, and finally, how is it disposed of? To assemble and store this array of hydrologic data, the District, as part of its basin management program, has undertaken the creation of a hydrologic data base. To facilitate the storage and retrieval of all pertinent data, the District utilizes an on-site high speed digital computer. Into this data base, the District has loaded all available information pertaining to ground-water production, streamflows and diversions, rainfall, ground-water levels, basin recharge, basin inflow/outflow, water quality, and consumptive use. Development and selection of alternative strategies is made more effective because of the availability of historic and real time hydrologic data. An additional benefit derived from the basin management program is that the updating of the operational economics associated with the importation of State Project water can be made with the benefit of the most current data available. This allows the District to optimize its programs and thus maximize the limited resources available to it."}, {"paperId": "00fd414253a32e605fdf7f3de9a2bc8ff0a7dbee", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00fd414253a32e605fdf7f3de9a2bc8ff0a7dbee", "title": "Improving GNSS-R Sea Surface Wind Speed Retrieval from FY-3E Satellite Using Multi-task Learning and Physical Information", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

(51 of those providers were part of an initial cohort of 51 scored for an earlier version of this paper.)Based on the scores of responses of 210 health care providers to record requests and the responses of nearly 3000 healthcare institutions to telephone surveys, more than 50% of health care providers are out of compliance with the HIPAA right of access. The most common failure was refusal to send records to patient or patient\u2019s designee in the form and format requested by the patient, with 86% of noncompliance due to this factor. The number of phone calls required to obtain records in compliance with HIPAA, and the lack of consistency in provider responses to actual requests, makes the records retrieval process a challenging one for patients.Recent federal proposals prioritize patient access to medical records through certified electronic health record (EHR) technology, but access by patients to their complete clinical records via EHRs is years away.

For instance, messages between Mars and Earth can take up to 24 minutes, making quick responses impossible. This limitation poses a challenge for astronauts who must rely on in-situ tools to access the large volume of data from spacecraft sensors, rovers, and satellites, data that is often fragmented and difficult to use. To bridge this gap, systems like the Mars Exploration Telemetry-Driven Information System (METIS) are being developed. METIS is an AI assistant designed to handle routine tasks, monitor spacecraft systems, and detect anomalies, all while reducing the reliance on mission control. Current Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) Models, while powerful, struggle in safety-critical environments. They can generate plausible but incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as\"hallucination,\"which could endanger astronauts. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes enhancing systems like METIS by integrating GPTs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Augmented Reality (AR). The idea is to allow astronauts to interact with their data more intuitively, using natural language queries and visualizing real-time information through AR. KGs will be used to easily access live telemetry and multimodal data, ensuring that astronauts have the right information at the right time. By combining AI, KGs, and AR, this new system will empower astronauts to work more autonomously, safely, and efficiently during future space missions."}, {"paperId": "0109a0a29d48116a7e099615dad6a56a7a52a3a6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0109a0a29d48116a7e099615dad6a56a7a52a3a6", "title": "A Survey of AI-Driven Mock Interviews Using GenAI and Machine Learning (InterviewX)", "year": 2024, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICUIS64676.2024.10866631?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUIS64676.2024.10866631, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Facebook's code base evolves rapidly, with thousands of code changes being committed to a monolithic repository every day. When a bug is detected, it is often time-sensitive and imperative to identify the commit causing the bug in order to either revert it or fix it. This is complicated by the fact that bugs often manifest with complex and unwieldy features, such as stack traces and other metadata. Code commits also have various features associated with them, ranging from developer comments to test results. This poses unique challenges to bug localization methods, making it a highly non-trivial operation. In this paper we lay out several practical concerns for industry-level IR-based bug localization, and propose Bug2Commit, a tool that is designed to address these concerns. We also assess the effectiveness of existing IR-based localization techniques from the software engineering community, and find that in the presence of complex queries or documents, which are common at Facebook, existing approaches do not perform as well as Bug2Commit. We evaluate Bug2Commit on three applications at Facebook: client-side crashes from the mobile app, server-side performance regressions, and mobile simulation tests for performance. We find that Bug2Commit outperforms the accuracy of existing approaches by up to 17%, leading to reduced time for triaging regressions and attributing bugs found in simulations."}, {"paperId": "010b331bb3dea3fdccf4cc2667d440d0b5856b73", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/010b331bb3dea3fdccf4cc2667d440d0b5856b73", "title": "Survey of semiconductor data management systems technology", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Since a single-domain system has limited applications, a multiple-domain system will be more useful. However, different types of audio data will have different properties, this will make a multiple-domain system harder to be developed. If we can classify audio information in advance, the above problems can be solved. In this paper, we will propose a real-time classification method to classify audio signals into several basic audio types such as pure speech, music, song, speech with music background, and speech with environmental noise background. In order to make the proposed method robust for a variety of audio sources, we use Bayesian decision function for multivariable Gaussian distribution instead of manually adjusting a threshold for each discriminator. The proposed approach can be applied to content-based audio/video retrieval. In the experiment, the efficiency and effectiveness of this method are shown by an accuracy rate of more than 96% for general audio data classification."}, {"paperId": "010c199b114719072b4863ca994ca830eb05e9f5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/010c199b114719072b4863ca994ca830eb05e9f5", "title": "Branding J & K Herbaceous Wealth", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "79419226", "name": "Neetu Andotra"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "010c3dded6feee49dd7ef2e6d4aff27d2f7f3e91", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/010c3dded6feee49dd7ef2e6d4aff27d2f7f3e91", "title": "Location-Aware Information Retrieval for Mobile Computing", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10397/8555", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

We evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context LLM-based approaches to address three key research questions: the impact of domain-specific components like section-based chunking and cross-referencing, the comparative performance of different retrievers and LLMs, and the viability of long-context LLMs as an alternative to RAG. Our results show that section-based chunking significantly improves retrieval and end-to-end performance, current retrievers struggle with complex queries, and long-context LLMs still underperform RAG-based systems in Thai legal QA. To support fair evaluation, we propose tailored multi-label retrieval metrics and the use of an LLM-as-judge for coverage and contradiction detection method. These findings highlight the limitations of current Thai legal NLP solutions and provide a foundation for future research in the field.

Feijt"}], "abstract": "This thesis is about observations of clouds from satellite and ground based instruments. The aim is to reconstruct the three dimensional cloud distributions. This information is used both in climate research and operational meteorological applications. In climate research, cloud observations provide a reference to atmospheric models, which enables optimization of cloud parameterizations. For operational meteorologists clouds are symptoms of atmospheric conditions. Cloud observations therefore are helpful in understanding the current weather (nowcasting) and improve the estimate of how of the atmospheric conditions will evolve (forecasting).In order to obtain cloud field characteristics, analysis environments were developed for the interpretation of meteorological satellite measurements in terms of cloud properties. A large effort was put in the evaluation of the results with synoptic observations and measurements from two measurement campaigns. As a result this thesis comprises three major research topics: Meteosat analysis, AVHRR analysis and combined analysis of ground and satellite observations. Meteosat analysis A new cloud detection scheme was developed that includes the use of the surface temperature fields of a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model as a threshold value to distinguish cloudy and cloud free areas. It is shown that also for cloud free conditions, the equivalent black body temperature as measured from satellite is different from the model surface temperature. An innovative part of the scheme is the quantification of this temperature difference, which is used to improve the skill of the cloud detection method. The improvement of the detection efficiency was quantified over land and ocean for 1997 on a 3 hourly basis in a semi-operational setting. As the method optimizes the use of the infrared information it is relatively insensitive to changes of insolation conditions with time of day, location, or season. AVHRR analysis The NWP model surface temperatures are also used in the AVHRR analysis environment. For the interpretation of the 0.6\u03bcm channel reflectivities, extensive radiative transfer calculations were done with the Doubling-Adding KNMI (DAK) radiative transfer code. The results were put in Look-up tables (LUT). The LUTs are used to obtain the following cloud field properties: cloud cover fraction, cloud top temperature, optical thickness and liquid water path. In order to assess the quality, the retrieved properties were compared to measurements from two campaigns: the Tropospheric Budget Experiment, TEBEX, and the Clouds and Radiation intensive measurement campaigns, CLARA. The comparison shows that the retrieval algorithms yield results that agree with independent ground based measurements for the cases studied. Combined analysis of satellite and ground observations Combined analysis of satellite and ground based observations from the TEBEX and CLARA data sets yields information on the quality of the satellite retrieval, but also on the merits of the ground based remote sensing instruments. The study shows that both observational sets have strong points, but a combination is preferred to obtain a good definition of the cloud field. In all comparisons the problem of collocation occurs. The ground based instruments measure continuous in time at one location, while satellites measure a spatial distribution at one moment in time. When comparing ground and satellite derived cloud products it is always questionable which part of the time series corresponds to which part of the spatial distribution. This correlation is studied by comparing variance spectra of time series and spatial distributions of liquid water path derived from microwave radiometer and AVHRR data respectively. It is shown that for two cases with different scaling properties the variance spectrum is similar for a part of the time-series and for a part of the AVHRR image.This thesis contributes to quantitative use of meteorological satellite data in meteorology and climate research. Furthermore, it advances combined analysis of space born and ground based remote sensing measurements of clouds for routine applications."}, {"paperId": "0113964c1dc23c494b5ff6d9cba0ccff927d4a03", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0113964c1dc23c494b5ff6d9cba0ccff927d4a03", "title": "KAG: Boosting LLMs in Professional Domains via Knowledge Augmented Generation", "year": 2024, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13731, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The key technologies of RAG are retrieval based on similarity and reasoning based on next-token prediction. However, this approach differs significantly from how humans solve problems. Humans typically follow certain analytical logic, reasoning while retrieving relevant information, and then connecting the clues to serve as references, ultimately generating an answer. In this process, the focus is on the semantic type and clear relationships between the keywords rather than similarity and co-occurrence. This difference in methodology results in the answers generated by RAG technology being insufficiently accurate or valuable. In this work, we concentrate on establishing semantic relationships between keywords to enable a more precise expression of knowledge and propose the Knowledge Augmented Generation(KAG) framework. KAG performs semantic parsing and reasoning on both documents and questions, involving three specific strategies: In the indexing phase, we complete the semantic information of keywords and the semantic relationships between them through information extraction and semantic reasoning; in the reasoning phase of question answering, we leverage semantic parsing to transform questions into Logical Forms with clear semantic types and relationships; in the retrieval phase, we predict the semantic relationships between Logical Form elements and structured index, thereby obtaining the required references. We compared KAG with existing RAG methods in three multi-hop QA datasets and the results show that KAG significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art. We also applied KAG to real E-Government Q&A business scenario, and achieving significant improvements in professionalism compared to traditional RAG methods. Meanwhile, to help developers easily build accurate and efficient domain knowledge QA services, our KAG natively supports the open-source KG engine OpenSPG."}, {"paperId": "0113d4334cc396dacdcd0e655d428f4828feb0ec", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0113d4334cc396dacdcd0e655d428f4828feb0ec", "title": "Exploiting the Similarity of Non-Matching Terms at Retrieval Time", "year": 2000, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Graph retrieval based on subgraph matching has a wide variety of applications, e.g., molecular fingerprint detection, circuit design, software analysis, and question answering. In such applications, a corpus graph is relevant to a query graph, if the query graph is (perfectly or approximately) a subgraph of the corpus graph. Existing neural graph retrieval models compare the node or graph embeddings of the query-corpus pairs, to compute the relevance scores between them. However, such models may not provide edge consistency between the query and corpus graphs. Moreover, they predominantly use symmetric relevance scores, which are not appropriate in the context of subgraph matching, since the underlying relevance score in subgraph search should be measured using the partial order induced by subgraph-supergraph relationship. Consequently, they show poor retrieval performance in the context of subgraph matching. In response, we propose ISONET, a novel interpretable neural edge alignment formulation, which is better able to learn the edge-consistent mapping necessary for subgraph matching. ISONET incorporates a new scoring mechanism which enforces an asymmetric relevance score, specifically tailored to subgraph matching. ISONET\u2019s design enables it to directly identify the underlying subgraph in a corpus graph, which is relevant to the given query graph. Our experiments on diverse datasets show that ISONET outperforms recent graph retrieval formulations and systems. Additionally, ISONET can provide interpretable alignments between query-corpus graph pairs during inference, despite being trained only using binary relevance labels of whole graphs during training, without any fine-grained ground truth information about node or edge alignments."}, {"paperId": "01154fa1b8a0262f3530c6add9e728912c4c0904", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01154fa1b8a0262f3530c6add9e728912c4c0904", "title": "Clouds Detection Algorithms for Proba-V", "year": null, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2310248431", "name": "L.

Over 40 experienced ERIC online searchers were interviewed and more than half of these volunteered to show us their activity online. Over 650 search traces from 18 different ERIC online searchers using three different retrieval systems were analyzed. Findings show that controlled vocabulary terms are used in 68% of ERIC searches. Controlled vocabulary searching is higher if only terms which resulted in offline printed output are considered. The use of free text was more carefully scrutinized to see if we could discover ways to improve the ERIC database and its online access, since free text searchers have few online search aids besides the basic index with postings information. The vocabulary in 165 free text search statements was analyzed to determine whether ERIC descriptors and identifiers were incapable of representing these concepts. Information for every free text statement was sought on the following questions: (1) Is it a descriptor? (2) Is it cross\u2010referenced to an accepted term? (3) Is it a variant of a descriptor? (4) Is it expressible using descriptors? (5) Is it expressible using identifiers? (6) Is it only expressible using free text? Five tables summarize the output results of our comparative analysis of free text and controlled vocabulary searching. Six categories of search concepts were discovered for which searchers could only input free text terms or phrases. Online searching tests comparing free and controlled vocabulary were performed using six search topics. The free text search formulations had higher recall and controlled vocabulary formulations had higher precision. Search objective (high recall or high precision), we concluded, should dictate which formulation to use. All our findings helped point to the need for new searching aids for online ERIC searchers. Four displays exhibit what these might be; for example, an on\u2010line rotated descriptor or identifier display, and some linkage between free text and the Thesaurus.

Some color-based systems coming into practical use are claimed to be limited to target videos with stable lighting. In this paper, a fuzzy mode similarity measure is proposed to adaptively calibrate the feature-matching criterion based on the measure of the illumination instability. The purpose of this approach is to retrieve the identical semantic object from the video and to alleviate the impact of lighting changes. An information-theoretic measure is first proposed to automatically measure the illumination instability of the video. A fuzzy model is then proposed to estimate and characterize the impact of illumination changes to the distribution shape of the semantic object in the low-level visual feature space. Experiments are shown to demonstrate how the proposed measure of the illumination instability, which takes the information distribution within an image into account, can reflect the instability more effectively than other simple and straightforward measures. Experiments also show how the retrieval performance can be improved by using the fuzzy mode similarity measure."}, {"paperId": "011931ce6c88c19e67b970e385ac82e8b83b7c93", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/011931ce6c88c19e67b970e385ac82e8b83b7c93", "title": "Information Retrieval usingSemantic WebBrowser - Personalized andCategorical WebSearch", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "73704518", "name": "M.

Biega"}], "abstract": "Following a period of expedited progress in the capabilities of digital systems, the society begins to realize that systems designed to assist people in various tasks can also harm individuals and society. Mediating access to information and explicitly or implicitly ranking people in increasingly many applications, search systems have a substantial potential to contribute to such unwanted outcomes. Since they collect vast amounts of data about both searchers and search subjects, they have the potential to violate the privacy of both of these groups of users. Moreover, in applications where rankings influence people\u2019s economic livelihood outside of the platform, such as sharing economy or hiring support websites, search engines have an immense economic power over their users in that they control user exposure in ranked results. This thesis develops new models and methods broadly covering different aspects of privacy and fairness in search systems for both searchers and search subjects. Specifically, it makes the following contributions: \u2022 We propose a model for computing individually fair rankings where search subjects get exposure proportional to their relevance. The exposure is amortized over time using constrained optimization to overcome searcher attention biases while preserving ranking utility. \u2022 We propose a model for computing sensitive search exposure where each subject gets to know the sensitive queries that lead to her profile in the top-k search results. The problem of finding exposing queries is technically modeled as reverse nearest neighbor search, followed by a weekly-supervised learning to rank model ordering the queries by privacy-sensitivity. \u2022 We propose a model for quantifying privacy risks from textual data in online communities. The method builds on a topic model where each topic is annotated by a crowdsourced sensitivity score, and privacy risks are associated with a user\u2019s relevance to sensitive topics. We propose relevance measures capturing different dimensions of user interest in a topic and show how they correlate with human risk perceptions. \u2022 We propose a model for privacy-preserving personalized search where search queries of different users are split and merged into synthetic profiles. The model mediates the privacy-utility trade-off by keeping semantically coherent fragments of search histories within individual profiles, while trying to minimize the similarity of any of the synthetic profiles to the original user profiles. The models are evaluated using information retrieval techniques and user studies over a variety of datasets, ranging from query logs, through social media and community question answering postings, to item listings from sharing economy platforms."}, {"paperId": "011ab2698b18bfd2d284bf1f200c0dd3fafe3387", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/011ab2698b18bfd2d284bf1f200c0dd3fafe3387", "title": "Analysis of Semantic Retrieval System Based on Information Resource Management A Comparative Analysis of Wolfram Alpha and Google", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/25894111.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2991/iccese-18.2018.257?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2991/iccese-18.2018.257, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We further develop this idea to operate on smaller discrete homogeneous spaces of the rotation group, where a polar view representation is used to maintain equivariance with only a fraction of the number of input views.

Currently, various works have been proposed to represent the complex semantics of source code from different views, including plain text, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and several kinds of code graphs (e.g., Control/Data Flow Graph). However, most of them only consider a single view of source code independently, ignoring the correspondences among different views. In this paper, we propose to integrate different views with the natural-language description of source code into a unified framework with Multi-View contrastive Pre-training, and name our model as CODE-MVP. Specifically, we first extract multiple code views using compiler tools, and learn the complementary information among them under a contrastive learning framework. Inspired by the type checking in compilation, we also design a fine-grained type inference objective in the pre-training. Experiments on three downstream tasks over five datasets demonstrate the superiority of CODE-MVP when compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. For example, we achieve 2.4/2.3/1.1 gain in terms of MRR/MAP/Accuracy metrics on natural language code retrieval, code similarity, and code defect detection tasks, respectively."}, {"paperId": "01220502f154b01259d687552cb94b24810dc45b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01220502f154b01259d687552cb94b24810dc45b", "title": "Rank-PointRetrieval: Reranking Point Cloud Retrieval via a Visually Consistent Registration Evaluation", "year": 2022, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Most existing deep hashing methods employ pairs or triplets of samples in training stage, which only consider the semantic similarity within a minibatch and depict the local positional relationship in Hamming space, leading to intermittent semantic similarity preservation. In this paper, we propose Deep Position-Aware Hashing (DPAH) to ensure continuous semantic similarity in Hamming space by modeling global positional relationship. Specifically, we introduce a set of learnable class centers as the global proxies to represent the global information and generate discriminative binary codes by constraining the distance between data points and class centers. In addition, in order to reduce the information loss caused by relaxing the binary codes to real-values in optimization, we propose kurtosis loss (KT loss) to handle the distribution of real-valued features before thresholding to be double-peak, and then enable the real-valued features to be more binarylike. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets show that our DPAH outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}, {"paperId": "0123b87dd6f2924c083da9139ac2b82c58e316fa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0123b87dd6f2924c083da9139ac2b82c58e316fa", "title": "From External Similarity to Internal Consistency: An Enhanced Retrieval-Based Method for LLMs' Reliable Content Generation", "year": 2025, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CSCWD64889.2025.11033484?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCWD64889.2025.11033484, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To address this problem, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed, which incorporates external knowledge to assist LLMs with content generation and significantly alleviates the hallucination problem. Nonetheless, the vanilla RAG uses similarity as the sole criterion for selecting external knowledge, neglecting the problem of internal inconsistency within the knowledge itself, which may distract LLMs from focusing on the most important information during the content generation process and, therefore, has a negative impact on the generated content's reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, Entropy-based Internal Consistency (EIC), to measure the internal consistency of the external knowledge which is then integrated with similarity to mutually determine the knowledge's importance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric can provide a more fine-grained signal for external knowledge selection, thereby enhancing the reliability of generated content."}, {"paperId": "012434387d4f5de4696c351f0b72e21793965bf6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012434387d4f5de4696c351f0b72e21793965bf6", "title": "METHODICAL FUNDAMENTALS OF TEACHING ELEMENTS OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS OF YOUNG SCHOOLCHILDREN WITH LIGHT DISORDERS OF INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pednauk.cuspu.edu.ua/index.php/pednauk/article/download/651/588/", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36550/2415-7988-2020-1-190-85-90?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36550/2415-7988-2020-1-190-85-90, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The computer, which has confidently and reliably taken its rightful place among all other traditional school subjects, as well as in the life of modern man, is actively implemented at the initial stage of a child's education. Disputes over the content of computer science itself as a school subject and its place in the main and variable components of the curriculum only increase its versatility. The use of a standard program in computer science and simulators, allows you to build the educational process of primary school, taking into account age and individual characteristics, the more it is necessary for inclusive education. The article is devoted to the methodological bases of teaching elements of computer literacy of junior schoolchildren with mild intellectual disabilities. The authors emphasize that currently in Ukraine the study of the information education sector by junior schoolchildren with mild intellectual disabilities is not conducted. At the same time, the formation of elements of computer literacy, in particular the study of computer graphics, is feasible for such students, given the peculiarities of the cognitive thinking of such students. The use of computers in the education of primary school students is not the only task of the computer science course. At present, experiments on the introduction of information and communication technologies in subject teaching are being actively conducted, traditional methods are being rethought, teaching concepts are being developed, and the pedagogical conditions for forming the basic concepts of the computer science course are being revised. However, it is not yet established what impact specific methods of activity can have on the structure of educational activities of primary school children with mild intellectual disabilities, which may contribute to the formation of computer literacy in grades 2-4 to prepare children with special needs. The study of computer science and the use of ICT in inclusive education promotes the development of skills and abilities of students with mental and physical disabilities to use a variety of information about the world, the ability to apply modern methods of accumulation, storage, retrieval and processing of information based on telecommunications networks.

A prior study found that comments can provide additional information to point out issues in their associated answer, such as the obsolescence of an answer. By showing more informative comments (e.g., the ones with higher scores) and hiding less informative ones, developers can more effectively retrieve information from the comments that are associated with an answer. Currently, Stack Overflow prioritizes the display of comments, and, as a result, 4.4 million comments (possibly including informative comments) are hidden by default from developers. In this study, we investigate whether this mechanism effectively organizes informative comments. We find that (1) the current comment organization mechanism does not work well due to the large amount of tie-scored comments (e.g., 87% of the comments have 0-score) and (2) in 97.3% of answers with hidden comments, at least one comment that is possibly informative is hidden while another comment with the same score is shown (i.e., unfairly hidden comments). The longest unfairly hidden comment is more likely to be informative than the shortest one. Our findings highlight that Stack Overflow should consider adjusting the comment organization mechanism to help developers effectively retrieve informative comments. Furthermore, we build a classifier that can effectively distinguish informative comments from uninformative comments. We also evaluate two alternative comment organization mechanisms (i.e., the Length mechanism and the Random mechanism) based on text similarity and the prediction of our classifier."}, {"paperId": "01285415d9811a248b91a2e964e12e19efccdd7a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01285415d9811a248b91a2e964e12e19efccdd7a", "title": "Proceedings, The Third AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32337919", "name": "Elizabet Gerber"}, {"authorId": "11143475", "name": "Panos Ipeirotis"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0128811cf34d64751f43dbb0286b531089ff14ea", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0128811cf34d64751f43dbb0286b531089ff14ea", "title": "Evaluation of Yield-Based Drought Tolerance Indices for Screening Safflower Genotypes", "year": 2014, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2134/AGRONJ13.0387?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2134/AGRONJ13.0387, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A proof is provided with a worked example. \nThe algorithm is non iterative and always halts successfully and the algorithm strictly follows Shannon's principle of making optimal use of information as it advances stage by stage. It also has a restart facility and can take care of new points from where it left off.At some later stage if the dimension of the data is increased from n to n+r, the algorithm can still continue from where it left off, after some simple adjustments, and tackle the new data points which are of a higher dimension. and separate them. The computational complexity is O(n.N log(N)) + O(n3 log(N)), where N is the given number of points and n3 is the cube of n - the dimension of space. The algorithm is made possible because a new concept called Orientation Vector is used. This vector is a Hamming vector and is associated with each point and has been so devised that it has all the information necessary to ascertain if two points are separate or not when among a collection of planes.Its application to data retrieval problems in very large medical data bases is also given."}, {"paperId": "012ad38dbb20bc4c2882f6bcf201c826da3b082c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012ad38dbb20bc4c2882f6bcf201c826da3b082c", "title": "Searching for better measures: Generating similarity functions for abstract musical objects", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The concept of Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR), on the other hand, identifies that peers and other human intermediaries play an important role in information behavior, both in formal and informal contexts. Researchers have documented the presence of collaboration in student information behavior in school libraries; however, the CIR concept has not been directly explored in K-12 education.

Recent publications in the journal Ukrainska mova ( Ukrainian language ) suggest that researchers are interested in a wide range of problems, in particular categorical-\u00adfunctional descriptions of the verb. The article by S. Sokolova and O. Achylova discusses the problem of verb translation. The authors use the terms aspektualnist\u2019 ( aspectuality ), rody diieslivnoi dii ( lexical aspects , or Aktionsarten ) and vydova neitralizatsiia ( aspect neutralization ).

The term vydova neitralizatsiia ( aspect neutralization ) is not included. This term is new and refers to a situation when the aspectual meaning of a verb is irrelevant in translation from Ukrainian into non-\u00adSlavic languages.

Unlike the traditional database queries which are mostly based on value equality, similarity queries aim to find targets\"similar enough to\"the given data objects, depending on some similarity metric, e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity and so on. To measure the similarity between data objects, traditional methods normally work on low level or syntax features(e.g., basic visual features on images or bag-of-word features of text), which makes them weak to compute the semantic similarities between objects. So for measuring data similarities semantically, neural embedding is applied. Embedding techniques work by representing the raw data objects as vectors (so called\"embeddings\"or\"neural embeddings\"since they are mostly generated by neural network models) that expose the hidden semantics of the raw data, based on which embeddings do show outstanding effectiveness on capturing data similarities, making it one of the most widely used and studied techniques in the state-of-the-art similarity query processing research. But there are still many open challenges on the efficiency of embedding based similarity query processing, which are not so well-studied as the effectiveness. In this survey, we first provide an overview of the\"similarity query\"and\"similarity query processing\"problems. Then we talk about recent approaches on designing the indexes and operators for highly efficient similarity query processing on top of embeddings (or more generally, high dimensional data). Finally, we investigate the specific solutions with and without using embeddings in selected application domains of similarity queries, including entity resolution and information retrieval. By comparing the solutions, we show how neural embeddings benefit those applications."}, {"paperId": "012fc0a1283578978a3415a7d8e762ed61585ef4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012fc0a1283578978a3415a7d8e762ed61585ef4", "title": "A Novel NOR-Type TCAM Deploy Dual-VT cell with OR-Type Cascade Match-Line Structure", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.35940/ijitee.j7376.0891020", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35940/ijitee.j7376.0891020?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35940/ijitee.j7376.0891020, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Sharing data with fellow researchers helps in increasing the visibility of the work. On the other hand, there are researchers who are inhibited by the lack of data resources. To overcome this challenge, many repositories and knowledge bases have been established to date to ease data sharing. Further, in the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the number of datasets added to these dataset repositories. However, most of these repositories are domain-specific, and none of them can recommend datasets to researchers/users. Naturally, it is challenging for a researcher to keep track of all the relevant repositories for potential use. Thus, a dataset recommender system that recommends datasets to a researcher based on previous publications can enhance their productivity and expedite further research. This work adopts an information retrieval (IR) paradigm for dataset recommendation. We hypothesize that two fundamental differences exist between dataset recommendation and PubMed-style biomedical IR beyond the corpus. First, instead of keywords, the query is the researcher, embodied by his or her publications. Second, to filter the relevant datasets from non-relevant ones, researchers are better represented by a set of interests, as opposed to the entire body of their research. This second approach is implemented using a non-parametric clustering technique. These clusters are used to recommend datasets for each researcher using the cosine similarity between the vector representations of publication clusters and datasets. The maximum normalized discounted cumulative gain at 10 (NDCG@10), precision at 10 (p@10) partial and p@10 strict of 0.89, 0.78 and 0.61, respectively, were obtained using the proposed method after manual evaluation by five researchers. As per the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind on content-based dataset recommendation. We hope that this system will further promote data sharing, offset the researchers\u2019 workload in identifying the right dataset and increase the reusability of biomedical datasets.

However, the Euclidean distances of CM data features are sensitive to the outlier data and may lead to non-robust retrieval performance, particularly in the case of noisy images with low quality. To address this issue, we propose a robust Hirschfeld-Gebelein\u2013R\u00e9nyi maximal correlation (HGRMC) augmented algorithm for CM-CBRSIR in this work, named by HGRMC augmented CM-CBRSIR (HAC). In HAC, not only the projected features of CM data in Euclidean distance space but also maximal correlation information of HGRMC are learned during the training phase of the retrieval model, where HGRMC is additionally used to capture the statistical dependency between CM data to enhance the retrieval performance with the strongly noisy input data. In the retrieval phase, we also develop a fusion scheme based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory to combine the superiorities of Euclidean distance and HGRMC correlation criteria. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HAC algorithm provides better and more robust retrieval performance in comparison with existing state-of-the-art CM-CBRSIR methods."}, {"paperId": "013351831686cac664f739b2b68457a67c6896cb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/013351831686cac664f739b2b68457a67c6896cb", "title": "SOME COMPUTING TECHNIQUES FOR STORAGE, RETRIEVAL AND INTERPRETATION OF GRAVIMETRIC DATA", "year": 1975, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1071/aj74010?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1071/aj74010, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These coefficients, which are designed for upward and downward continuation and long and short wavelength filtering of potential fields, have each been applied to the test data with various grid spacings. Computer presentation of results allows quick evaluation and comparison of each operator set. Results obtained are suitable for qualitative examination and in the examples chosen indicate limits of intracratonic basins and some detail within them. The nature of this information depends on the grid spacing and operator used. Large amplitude anomalies which cover a considerable area and are due to basement features become more apparent than on the Bouguer anomaly data. An estimate of depth to major density discontinuities has been obtained. Future aims of the project are: (i) processing of raw data files to prepare and update integrated Bouguer anomaly maps using more accurate density information for the Bouguer correction, and (ii) preparation of processed maps on a statewide basis to aid interpretation of the tectonic and basin framework of the State of South Australia."}, {"paperId": "01338151f4ba27d192e048415a981bcf90d8db61", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01338151f4ba27d192e048415a981bcf90d8db61", "title": "Assess the Impact of Climate Change on Agricultural Productivity Using GES DISC Data on Temperature, Precipitation, and Drought Indices", "year": 2024, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics262780.2024.10661069?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics262780.2024.10661069, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study presents a comprehensive regional-level analysis, leveraging rich datasets from the Goddard Earth Science Data & Information Center (GES DISC) and the Galaxy Workflow Engine, an open-source science tool enabling Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) science. The workflow, executed through Galaxy with high-performance computing resources from the National Science Foundation\u2019s Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (NSF ACCESS), is applied to selected states in the United States of America and selected countries in Southeast Asia and Africa. The area of interest can be predefined or defined by an arbitrary polygon, enabled by processing capabilities for interoperability on both climate variables and agricultural productivity implemented in the Galaxy toolshed. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) API - Processes service is used for customization services. Advanced analysis techniques, including time series analysis, machine learning, and statistical correlation, are incorporated to assess the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity. By leveraging GES DISC data, Galaxy Climate tools, and NSF ACCESS resources, valuable insights into the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity in various regions are gained. This informs the development of adaptation strategies, improvement of agricultural practices, and ensures long-term food security. The use of Galaxy workflows and GES DISC Giovanni for profiled time series data retrieval contributes to the development of an Open Science workflow, promoting open science principles and enhancing research reproducibility and accessibility. The designed workflow is reusable and can be applied to different regions, enhancing its utility for broader climate change impact assessments."}, {"paperId": "0133b0f74154e546e739daba8bafda698f721f7a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0133b0f74154e546e739daba8bafda698f721f7a", "title": "Peeling apparatus of reflect layer makes use microwave", "year": 2007, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "87452772", "name": "\uae40\uad11\uc218"}, {"authorId": "2074438304", "name": "\uae40\ud615\uc12d"}, {"authorId": "2071741458", "name": "\uc1a1\uaddc\uc12d"}, {"authorId": "2078069509", "name": "\uc1a1\ubbfc\uadfc"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0133b6885f80a3137b40f00f2a1b5711f83c62ff", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0133b6885f80a3137b40f00f2a1b5711f83c62ff", "title": "SPGGEN: a computer program for retrieval of space\u2010group information in several settings and generator\u2010containing space\u2010group symbols", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1107/S1600576716007330?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576716007330, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration of the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic queries that are complementary to template-based methods. We investigate whether the methods (a) generate queries that are similar to randomly sampled, representative, and anonymized user queries from a popular VA, and (b) whether the generated queries are specific. We find that LLMs generate more verbose queries, compared to template-based methods, and reference aspects specific to the entity. However, the generated queries are similar to VA user queries, and are specific enough to retrieve the relevant entity. We conclude that queries generated by LLMs and templates are complementary."}, {"paperId": "01377dcb24eabb43fd9fdcd321a75f7ab8ca7ba8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01377dcb24eabb43fd9fdcd321a75f7ab8ca7ba8", "title": "VidText: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation for Video Text Understanding", "year": 2025, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22810, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18 state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in dynamic environments."}, {"paperId": "01383839e39bdda0a17e96583016c3ef570de5e7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01383839e39bdda0a17e96583016c3ef570de5e7", "title": "An Effective Health Information Management System for Optimal Healthcare Delivery", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.30534/ijatcse/2021/081062021", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30534/ijatcse/2021/081062021?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30534/ijatcse/2021/081062021, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to\"forget\"earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks."}, {"paperId": "013a4fb6b05fe6ab4de558652b3d18460f1a1ce3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/013a4fb6b05fe6ab4de558652b3d18460f1a1ce3", "title": "CWI at INEX 2002", "year": 2002, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1798259", "name": "J.

However, in multiple cases, the documents are heterogeneous with different modalities such as images and flow diagrams, giving rise to the need for handling multiple modalities. Thus, multimodal document classification enables a more comprehensive understanding of document content by incorporating multiple modalities such as text and images. This enhances information extraction and enables more accurate categorization of documents, benefiting various applications such as content organization, search, recommendation systems, and information retrieval. This work proposes a deep learning approach that leverages both textual and image information for improved classification of multimodal documents. Our multimodal deep neural network architecture utilizes two different channels in processing the multimodal features: text and document images. The textual model leverages BERT to generate embeddings of the text, while the image feature extraction channel employs a hybrid architecture consisting of the pre-trained convolutional neural network model VGG-19 as the backbone followed by a vision transformer. The two different channels are incorporated into a unified framework that performs the final classification. The training and testing of the proposed framework were conducted on the benchmark TOBACCO-3482 dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of our proposed multimodal classification approach. The TOBACCO-3482 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for document image analysis and classification. The effectiveness in performing the classification of the proposed framework is evaluated on the grounds of performance metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."}, {"paperId": "013db72736d3bd4e8076ea49fe01bc246e1a2bc1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/013db72736d3bd4e8076ea49fe01bc246e1a2bc1", "title": "Automatic Counting System Using IoT and Computer Vision", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ISCON52037.2021.9702298?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCON52037.2021.9702298, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In a digital library, however, the goal is to not involve people, and so queries which eliminate precision problems in query results are in demand as a replacement for the librarian. In current retrieval systems, precision is improved by using a hierarchical method such as synonym notation processing. In methods based on word systems, processing to handle the inadequate expression of the intention of a query or the semantic interpretation of a query are insufficient, and information retrieval from a more hierarchical perspective is needed. In this paper the authors propose a retrieval method using a hierarchical perspective based on a system of concepts, and not a retrieval method based on conventional word systems. By adopting the EDR electronic dictionary as a thesaurus and using concept information, queries and words which appear in papers are not processed merely as character strings, but are used in queries with consideration for the meaning of the words. The authors' method can estimate imprecise information in the intentions of queries and the meaning hidden in words, allowing for appropriate query results to be provided to users without the cooperation of a librarian. \u00a9 2001 Scripta Technica, Syst Comp Jpn, 32(8): 40\u201352, 2001"}, {"paperId": "014081b4663b727176c0318b43fd41693adffd5b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014081b4663b727176c0318b43fd41693adffd5b", "title": "Blind interference alignment for private information retrieval", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.07885", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07885, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On the unit exams and on an end-of-semester exam, students performed better for information that had been quizzed than that not quizzed. An unanticipated and key finding is that the format of the quiz (multiple-choice or short-answer) did not need to match the format of the criterial test (e.g., unit exam) for this benefit to emerge. Further, intermittent quizzing cannot be attributed to intermittent reexposure to the target facts: A restudy condition produced less enhancement of later test performance than did quizzing with feedback. Frequent classroom quizzing with feedback improves student learning and retention, and multiple-choice quizzing is as effective as short-answer quizzing for this purpose."}, {"paperId": "0142c16a9d7dd9a196a3a6e3b75e7ca55483c7dc", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0142c16a9d7dd9a196a3a6e3b75e7ca55483c7dc", "title": "An Ontology-Based Information Extraction System for Organic Farming", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4018/IJSWIS.2021040105?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4018/IJSWIS.2021040105, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While such fusion promises a holistic view, our investigations shed light on potential pitfalls. We uncover that prevailing late-fusion techniques often produce suboptimal latent representations when compared to methods that train modalities in isolation. We argue that this effect is largely due to the inadvertent relaxation of the training objectives on individual modalities when using fusion, what others have termed modality laziness. We present a nuanced point-of-view that this relaxation can lead to certain modalities failing to fully harness available task-relevant information, and yet, offers a protective veil to noisy modalities, preventing them from overfitting to task-irrelevant data. Our findings also show that unimodal concatenation (UniCat) and other late-fusion ensembling of unimodal backbones, when paired with best-known training techniques, exceed the current state-of-the-art performance across several multimodal ReID benchmarks. By unveiling the double-edged sword of\"modality laziness\", we motivate future research in balancing local modality strengths with global representations."}, {"paperId": "0143a834c8c2af1b84d71126475fb29c6fb67ec7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0143a834c8c2af1b84d71126475fb29c6fb67ec7", "title": "Compositional Vector Semantics Over Different Ground Fields", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument, launched in October 2017, provides unique observations of atmospheric trace gases at a high resolution of about 5\u2009km, with near-daily global coverage, resolving individual sources like thermal powerplants, industrial complexes, fires, medium-scale towns, roads, and shipping routes. Even though Sentinel-5P (S5P) is a global mission, these datasets are especially well suited to test high-resolution regional-scale air quality (AQ) models and provide valuable input for emission inversion systems. In Europe, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) has implemented an operational regional AQ forecasting capability based on an ensemble of several European models, available at a resolution of 0.1\u2218\u2009\u00d7\u20090.1\u2218. In this paper, we present comparisons between TROPOMI observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and the CAMS AQ forecasts and analyses of NO2. We discuss the different ways of making these comparisons and present quantitative results in the form of maps for individual days, summer and winter months, and a time series for European subregions and cities between May\u00a02018 and March\u00a02021. The CAMS regional products generally capture the fine-scale daily and averaged features observed by TROPOMI in much detail. In summer, the comparison shows a close agreement between TROPOMI and the CAMS ensemble NO2 tropospheric columns with a relative difference of up to 15\u2009% for most European cities. In winter, however, we find a significant discrepancy in the column amounts over much of Europe, with relative differences up to 50\u2009%. The possible causes for these differences are discussed, focusing on the possible impact of retrieval and modeling errors. Apart from comparisons with the CAMS ensemble, we also present results for comparisons with the individual CAMS models for selected months. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the free tropospheric contribution to the estimation of the tropospheric column and thus include profile information from the CAMS configuration of the ECMWF's (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) global integrated model above 3\u2009km altitude in the comparisons. We also show that replacing the global 1\u2218\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2218 a priori information in the retrieval by the regional 0.1\u2218\u2009\u00d7\u20090.1\u2218 resolution profiles of CAMS leads to significant changes in the TROPOMI-retrieved tropospheric column, with typical increases at the emission hotspots up to 30\u2009% and smaller increases or decreases elsewhere. As a spinoff, we present a new TROPOMI NO2 level\u00a02 (L2) data product for Europe, based on the replacement of the original TM5-MP generated global a priori profile by the regional CAMS ensemble profile. This European NO2 product is compared with ground-based remote sensing measurements of six Pandora instruments of the Pandonia Global Network and nine Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments. As compared to the standard S5P tropospheric NO2 column data, the overall bias of the new product for all except two stations is 5\u2009% to 12\u2009% smaller, owing to a reduction in the multiplicative bias. Compared to the CAMS tropospheric NO2 columns, dispersion and correlation parameters with respect to the standard data are, however, superior.\n"}, {"paperId": "0146400fd8205d5e9a915c60499c27c505fbbef4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0146400fd8205d5e9a915c60499c27c505fbbef4", "title": "Intelligent Conversational Android ERICA Applied to Attentive Listening and Job Interview", "year": 2021, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00403, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We set up several social interaction tasks for ERICA, including attentive listening, job interview, and speed dating. To allow for spontaneous, incremental multiple utterances, a robust turn-taking model is implemented based on TRP (transition-relevance place) prediction, and a variety of backchannels are generated based on time frame-wise prediction instead of IPU-based prediction. We have realized an open-domain attentive listening system with partial repeats and elaborating questions on focus words as well as assessment responses. It has been evaluated with 40 senior people, engaged in conversation of 5-7 minutes without a conversation breakdown. It was also compared against the WOZ setting. We have also realized a job interview system with a set of base questions followed by dynamic generation of elaborating questions. It has also been evaluated with student subjects, showing promising results."}, {"paperId": "0147153ed5a1fb1cc0f7250da0349662c03269f2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0147153ed5a1fb1cc0f7250da0349662c03269f2", "title": "On Embedding Implementations in Text Ranking and Classification Employing Graphs", "year": 2024, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/10/1897/pdf?version=1715506043", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/electronics13101897?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13101897, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

G., Tombros, A., & Stockman, T. (2012). A comparative analysis of the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired and sighted searchers. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63(2), 377\u2013391. doi: 10.1002/asi.21696 \n \nObjective \u2013 To determine how the behaviour of visually impaired persons significantly differs from that of sighted persons in the carrying out of complex search tasks on the internet. \n \nDesign \u2013 A comparative observational user study, plus semi-structured interviews. \n \nSetting \u2013 Not specified. \n \nSubjects \u2013 15 sighted and 15 visually impaired persons, all of them experienced and frequent Internet search engine users, of both sexes and varying in age from early \ntwenties to mid-fifties. \n \n \nMethods \u2013 The subjects carried out self-selected complex search tasks on their own equipment and in their own familiar environments. The investigators observed this activity to some extent directly, but for the most part via video camera, through use of a screen-sharing facility, or with screen-capture software. They distinguished four stages of search task activity: query formulation, search results exploration, query reformulation, and search results management. The visually impaired participants, of whom 13 were totally blind and two had only marginal vision, were all working with text-to-speech screen readers and depended exclusively for all their observed activity on those applications\u2019 auditory output. For data analysis, the investigators devised a grounded-theory-based coding scheme. They employed a search log format for deriving further quantitative data which they later controlled for statistical significance (two-tailed unpaired t-test; p < 0.05). The interviews allowed them to document, in particular, how the visually impaired subjects themselves subsequently accounted for, interpreted, and vindicated various observed aspects of their searching behaviour. \n \nMain Results \u2013 The investigators found significant differences between the sighted participants\u2019 search behaviour and that of the visually impaired searchers. The latter displayed a clearly less \u201corienteering\u201d (O'Day & Jeffries, 1993) disposition and style, more often starting out with already relatively long and comprehensive combinations of relatively precise search terms; \u201ctheir queries were more expressive\u201d (p. 386). They submitted fewer follow-up queries, and were considerably less inclined to attempt query reformulation. They were aiming to achieve a satisfactory search outcome in a single step. Nevertheless, they rarely employed advanced operators, and made far less use (in only 4 instances) of their search engine\u2019s query-support features than did the sighted searchers (37 instances). Fewer of them (13%) ventured beyond the first page of the results returned for their query by the search engine than was the case among the sighted searchers (43%). They viewed fewer (a mean of 4.27, as opposed to 13.40) retrieved pages, and they visited fewer external links (6 visits by 4 visually impaired searchers, compared with 34 visits by 11 sighted searchers). The visually impaired participants more frequently engaged in note taking than did the sighted participants. \n \nThe visually impaired searchers were in some cases, the investigators discovered, unaware of search engine facilities or searching tactics which might have improved their search outcomes. Yet even when they were aware of these, they very often chose not to employ them because doing so via their screen readers would have cost them more time and effort than they were willing to expend. In general, they were more diffident and less resourceful than the sighted searchers, and had more trust in the innate capacity and reliability of their search engine to return in an efficient manner the best available results. \n \nConclusion \u2013 Despite certain inherent limitations of the present study (the relatively small sample sizes and the non-randomness of the purposive sighted-searcher sample, the possible presence of extraneous variables, the impossibility of entirely ruling out familiarity bias), its findings strongly support the conclusion that working with today\u2019s search engine user interfaces through the intermediation of currently available assistive technologies necessarily imposes severe limits on the degree to which visually impaired persons can efficiently search the web for information relevant to their needs. The findings furthermore suggest that there are various measures that it would be possible to take toward alleviating the situation, in the form of further improvements to retrieval systems, to search interfaces, and to text-to-speech screen readers. Such improvements would include: \n \n\u2022 more accessible system hints to support a better, and less cognitively intensive, query formulation; \n\u2022 web page layouts which are more suitable to screen-reader intermediation; \n\u2022 a results presentation which more readily facilitates browsing and exploratory behaviour, preferably including auditory previews and overviews; \n\u2022 presentation formats which allow for quicker and more accurate relevance judgments; \n\u2022 mechanisms for (a better) monitoring of search progress. \n \nIn any event, further information behaviour studies ought now to be conducted, with the specific aim of more closely informing the development of user interfaces which will offer the kind of support that visually impaired Internet searchers are most in need of. Success in this undertaking will ultimately contribute to the further empowerment of visually disabled persons and thereby facilitate efforts to combat social exclusion."}, {"paperId": "01497d2f951243a03f9217a060a3ce9f19767e69", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01497d2f951243a03f9217a060a3ce9f19767e69", "title": "ChronoZoom: travel through time for education, exploration, and information technology research", "year": 2013, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Social psychologists have long debated whether the information that perceivers have about categories of people--i.e. stereotypes--may be a unique form of semantics. Here, we examine this question against well-established findings regarding the neural basis of semantics, which suggest that two brain regions--left inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex--are critical for general semantic knowledge. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants answered questions about their knowledge of both non-social and social categories. We reasoned that if stereotypes are a typical form of semantic knowledge, then these same regions should subserve the activation and retrieval of stereotypes. Inconsistent with this possibility, left inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex were activated only during non-social category judgments. Instead, judgments of social categories were associated with regions frequently linked to social cognition, including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, bilateral temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal cortex. Together, these results suggest that social stereotypes should be considered distinct from other forms of semantic knowledge, and may have more in common with representing mental states than retrieving semantic knowledge about objects and non-human living things."}, {"paperId": "014a298459e1e9494734cf9fd5a987b40e021478", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014a298459e1e9494734cf9fd5a987b40e021478", "title": "CRAM: Code Recommendation With Programming Context Based on Self-Attention Mechanism", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/TR.2022.3171309?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2022.3171309, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Individuals with ASD show impairment in memory tasks that require the processing of relational and contextual information, but spared performance on tasks requiring more item-based, acontextual processing. Two experiments investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying this memory profile. Method: A sample of 14 children with a diagnosis of high-functioning ASD (age: M = 12.2 years), and a matched control group of 14 typically developing (TD) children (age: M = 12.1 years), participated in a range of behavioral memory tasks in which we measured both relational and item-based memory abilities. They also completed a battery of executive function measures. Results: The ASD group showed specific deficits in relational memory, but spared or superior performance in item-based memory, across all tasks. Importantly, for ASD children, executive ability was significantly correlated with relational memory but not with item-based memory. No such relationship was present in the control group. This suggests that children with ASD atypically employed effortful, executive strategies to retrieve relational (but not item-specific) information, whereas TD children appeared to use more automatic processes. Conclusions: The relational memory impairment in ASD may result from a specific impairment in automatic associative retrieval processes with an increased reliance on effortful and strategic retrieval processes. Our findings allow specific neural predictions to be made regarding the interactive functioning of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex in ASD as a neural network supporting relational memory processing."}, {"paperId": "014b8834dafb54c99d17b9b725c706ae315f0651", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014b8834dafb54c99d17b9b725c706ae315f0651", "title": "MEDICAL IMAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM BASED ON INTERACTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM WITH USER RELEVANCE FEEDBACK", "year": 2012, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2124675407", "name": "V.

These algorithms build summaries (both concise and diverse), by selecting appropriate segments from the input signal, also making them good candidates to summarize music. We evaluate the summarization process on binary and multiclass music genre classification tasks, by comparing the accuracy when using summarized datasets against the accuracy when using human-oriented summaries, continuous segments (the traditional method used for addressing the previously mentioned time constraints), and full songs of the original dataset. We show that GRASSHOPPER, LexRank, LSA, MMR, and a Support Sets-based centrality model improve classification performance when compared to selected baselines. We also show that summarized datasets lead to a classification performance whose difference is not statistically significant from using full songs.

A method is described to classify cloud mixtures of cloud\ntop types, termed cloud scenes, using cloud type classification derived from the CloudSat\nradar (2B-CLDCLASS). The scale dependence of the cloud scenes is quantified.\nFor spatial scales at 45\u2009km (15\u2009km), only 18 (10) out of 256 possible cloud\nscenes account for 90\u2009% of all observations and contain one, two,\nor three cloud types. The number of possible cloud scenes is shown to depend\non spatial scale with a maximum number of 210 out of 256 possible scenes at\na scale of 105\u2009km and fewer cloud scenes at smaller and larger scales. The\ncloud scenes are used to assess the characteristics of spatially collocated\nAtmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) thermodynamic-phase and ice cloud\nproperty retrievals within scenes of varying cloud type complexity. The\nlikelihood of ice and liquid-phase detection strongly depends on the\nCloudSat-identified cloud scene type collocated with the AIRS footprint.\nCloud scenes primarily consisting of cirrus, nimbostratus, altostratus, and\ndeep convection are dominated by ice-phase detection, while stratocumulus,\ncumulus, and altocumulus are dominated by liquid- and undetermined-phase\ndetection. Ice cloud particle size and optical thickness are largest for\ncloud scenes containing deep convection and cumulus and are smallest for\ncirrus. Cloud scenes with multiple cloud types have small reductions in\ninformation content and slightly higher residuals of observed and modeled\nradiance compared to cloud scenes with single cloud types. These results\nwill help advance the development of temperature, specific humidity, and\ncloud property retrievals from hyperspectral infrared sounders that include\ncloud microphysics in forward radiative transfer models.\n"}, {"paperId": "014f2c3bfd9fd98a78d69851705f6593ba0f3fd8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014f2c3bfd9fd98a78d69851705f6593ba0f3fd8", "title": "Machines that Learn how to Code Open-Ended Survey Data.

As well, the data will be contaminated with non-stationary artifacts, such as glitches and data gaps, which are expected to strongly impact the MBHB analysis, which mandates the development of dedicated detection and retrieval methods on long time intervals. Building upon a methodological approach we introduced for galactic binaries, in this article we investigate an original non-parametric recovery of MBHB signals from measurements with instrumental noise typical of LISA in order to tackle detection and signal reconstruction tasks on long time intervals. We investigated different approaches based on sparse signal modeling and machine learning. In this framework, we focused on recovering MBHB waveforms on long time intervals, which is a building block to further tackling more general signal recovery problems, from gap mitigation to unmixing overlapped signals. To that end, we introduced a hybrid method called SCARF (sparse chirp adaptive representation in Fourier), which combines a deep learning modeling of the merger of the MBHB with a specific adaptive time-frequency representation of the inspiral. Numerical experiments have been carried out on simulations of single MBHB events that account for the LISA response and with realistic realizations of noise. We checked the performances of the proposed hybrid method for the fast detection and recovery of the MBHB."}, {"paperId": "0150f5ec130f8c68fe55e6d0a3501cd1bcc08521", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0150f5ec130f8c68fe55e6d0a3501cd1bcc08521", "title": "TIRS: a topological information retrieval system satisfying the requirements of the Waller-Kraft wish list", "year": 1987, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Just one decade in the past would show our field as being composed of a few scattered workshops. Since then there has been tremendous growth in both research and applications. In the past 4 years, as a community we have published over a 1,000 peer reviewed research papers in areas ranging from image and audio retrieval to scientific and medical image search. We have developed our own test sets, software libraries, evaluation benchmarks, workshops and major conferences (notably ICMR, CIVR, and MIR). Only one important piece was missing to make the picture complete: a research journal. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce the first journal focused on our field, The International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval (IJMIR). Our new journal encompasses all topics related to retrieval, exploration, and mining of media databases and collections. It combines the vibrant areas related to retrieval of images, audio, video, and medical and scientific imagery with understanding of the human side of the system including the social aspects which are crucial to interactive search. An unarguable strength of our field is that it plays an important role in diverse scientific areas because many significant recent discoveries have been made through analyzing and searching local and international imaging databases. In our journal, there are essentially two paper categories: regular papers (original research) and surveys. Regular papers are typically triple peer reviewed and are meant to represent the novel research from the community.

It is an important task with applications to information retrieval and text summarization. When labeled training data is available, traditional approaches for sequence tagging can be used for credit attribution. However, generating such labeled datasets is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present Credit Attribution With Attention (CAWA), a neural-network-based approach, that instead of using sentence-level labeled data, uses the set of class labels that are associated with an entire document as a source of distant-supervision. CAWA combines an attention mechanism with a multilabel classifier into an end-to-end learning framework to perform credit attribution. CAWA labels the individual sentences from the input document using the resultant attention-weights. CAWA improves upon the state-of-the-art credit attribution approach by not constraining a sentence to belong to just one class, but modeling each sentence as a distribution over all classes, leading to better modeling of semantically-similar classes. Experiments on the credit attribution task on a variety of datasets show that the sentence class labels generated by CAWA outperform the competing approaches. Additionally, on the multilabel text classification task, CAWA performs better than the competing credit attribution approaches1."}, {"paperId": "0156b737d59ac4445b743c60ba638eca82531752", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0156b737d59ac4445b743c60ba638eca82531752", "title": "Evolving local and global weighting schemes in information retrieval", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Since the proposed method is able to embed secret information into more significant bits of the image, it has improved embedding payload. The steps of extracting data from the host image are independent of the original image. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has a blind detection process which is more suitable for practical and online applications.

The pixels with more steganographic difference values in rows or columns are determined, after which the steganography and ciphertext retrieval steps are performed in the rows or columns of the digital image. The experiment results prove that the method replaces the block structure in frame selection by groups of continuously read pixels, i.e., every three pixels form a pixel group where two bits of confidential information can be hidden, thus improving the steganographic capacity effectively. Comparisons with other PVO hiding schemes confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme, which has a higher capacity and maintains an acceptable peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)."}, {"paperId": "01591390da1356b871aefe11d4bb92c1df5ba082", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01591390da1356b871aefe11d4bb92c1df5ba082", "title": "Online Appendix to : Content-based Image Retrieval", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2296483741", "name": "Haoran Wang"}, {"authorId": "2362370577", "name": "Yuanbin Wang"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "015a04182e9c69b459536660eadedf435a4b87b0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/015a04182e9c69b459536660eadedf435a4b87b0", "title": "Design and Implement of Customer Information Retrieval System Based on Semantic Web", "year": 2006, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Code search aims to retrieve and reuse code from extensive repositories based on a search query with specific requirements. Recently, pre-trained model-based approaches have become popular because of grasping semantic representations of code snippets and search queries accurately. However, such approaches ignore the inconsistency between code and query statements due to the redundant tokens, such as definitions and punctuation marks in the code snippets, which hinder the matching accuracy. To tackle such disadvantage, in this paper, two strategies are proposed based on explicit or implicit code representation summarization. By summarizing the code representation, the redundancy in the code is removed and the inconsistency between code and query statements is alleviated. For the explicit code representation summarization-based strategy, different views of contextual information are obtained and summarized based on different scales of pyramidal dilated convolution.

Onion-routing achieves low latency, high bandwidth, and scalable anonymous communication, but is susceptible to traffic analysis attacks. Designs based on DC-Nets, on the other hand, protect the users against traffic analysis attacks, but sacrifice bandwidth. Verifiable mixnets maintain strong anonymity with low bandwidth overhead, but suffer from high computation overhead instead. In this paper, we present Riffle, a bandwidth and computation efficient communication system with strong anonymity. Riffle consists of a small set of anonymity servers and a large number of users, and guarantees anonymity among all honest clients as long as there exists at least one honest server. Riffle uses a new hybrid verifiable shuffle technique and private information retrieval for bandwidth- and computation-efficient anonymous communication. Our evaluation of Riffle in file sharing and microblogging applications shows that Riffle can achieve a bandwidth of over 100KB/s per user in an anonymity set of 200 users in the case of file sharing, and handle over 100,000 users with less than 10 second latency in the case of microblogging."}, {"paperId": "015d8935d6aa8fc7814a7719b2cfaed0022a924c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/015d8935d6aa8fc7814a7719b2cfaed0022a924c", "title": "Location Tracking Paradigm-Identifiers in Pervasive Computing", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2365792560", "name": "M.

Description We built a database to collect eccDNA, including animals, plants and fungi, and provide researchers with an eccDNA retrieval platform. The collected eccDNAs were processed in a uniform format and classified according to the species to which it belongs and the chromosome of the source. Each eccDNA record contained sequence length, start and end sites on the corresponding chromosome, order of the bases, genomic elements such as genes and transposons, and other information in the respective sequencing experiment. All the data were stored into the TeCD (The eccDNA Collection Database) and the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) sequence alignment function was also added into the database for analyzing the potential eccDNA sequences. Conclusion We built TeCD, a platform for users to search and obtain eccDNA data, and analyzed the possible potential functions of eccDNA. These findings may provide a basis and direction for researchers to further explore the biological significance of eccDNA in the future."}, {"paperId": "015f3a29af0eb2865ba1fe0a6bcf5b9bc9c454a5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/015f3a29af0eb2865ba1fe0a6bcf5b9bc9c454a5", "title": "GNSS tropospheric gradients with high temporal resolution and their effect on precise positioning", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2015JD024255", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

This method can represent the semantic information of short text message thoroughly so as to improve the accuracy of similarity calculation. We selected a large number of problem test sets for experiments. The results show that the method we proposed is reasonable and effective. I. INTRODUCTION With the wide application of short text similarity calculation method in information retrieval, question- answering system, text mining and other natural language processing fields, the research and improvement on the calculation method of short text similarity has become an important research hotspot. The research finds that there are many differences between the calculation methods of short text similarity and document similarity. As the document contains large amount of word information, most of the similarity calculation method is based on word statistical method. However, the short text contains little word information, maybe even only one word. It is not sufficient to judge the similarity between the short texts accurately only using the information of the short text itself. Therefore, in order to improve the calculation accuracy of short text similarity, we need to solve two key problems. The first problem is how to fully expressed and reflected short text information? The information includes word frequency, word meaning, etc. The second problem is how to calculate the similarity between the short texts? In order to solve these two problems, this paper presents the calculation method of Chinese short text semantic similarity based on the semantic feature space. This method represent the semantic information of short text message thoroughly so as to improve the accuracy of similarity calculation. We selected a large number of problem test sets for experiments. The results show that the method we proposed is reasonable and effective. II. CONSTRUCTION METHOD OF SEMANTIC FEATURE SPACE We take the intelligent-service system as the research background. The main short texts in the system are advisory information (namely interrogative sentences) and response short texts. In the intelligent service system, there are many users asking for advices every day, which inevitably produces massive consultation information. We can use these historical advisory information, namely short text sets to construct the semantic feature space, and then build the model by using the new consultation of the users or questioning short text in the space, finally we can calculate the similarity between the new short text and historical short text. The semantic feature space has a similar construction process with the ordinary vector space, which also consists of two main steps: feature selection and feature dimension reduction."}, {"paperId": "016593bda0e35dfa0f3cd139a013df043fc1e0cd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016593bda0e35dfa0f3cd139a013df043fc1e0cd", "title": "Computerised legal information services in Norway", "year": 2005, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144724332", "name": "J.

However, in today\u2019s era of exponentially growing data volumes available over the internet, acquiring highquality data for feature selection poses a significant challenge in LTR. The emerging method of employing neural network-based feature selection in learning to rank utilizes machine learning methodologies to identify and choose relevant features, to enhanced efficiency and improve the ranking. This strategy overcome the constraints of conventional LTR methods and enhances the ranking performance across diverse applications. This research presents a new iteration of a sequential neural network model through the utilization of existing models, along with an analysis of its attributes. A distinctive approach to feature selection utilizing neural networks is outlined in this research for learning to rank, employing LambdaMART, a gradient boosting algorithm, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ranking protocols on extensive datasets. The proposed method performance is better than the few existing state-of-arts algorithms. The model performance found as 0.711 NDCG, 0.61 P@K,0.611 on MSLR Web 30k and proposed model useful in many real time ranking applications."}, {"paperId": "0165b52798709184c9a62c6b51b4fd06dfe76e70", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0165b52798709184c9a62c6b51b4fd06dfe76e70", "title": "An efficient phase retrieval method using snakes for image reconstruction", "year": 2004, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Among other applications, it has been a key building block for large language models and advanced computer vision systems based on contrastive learning. A core component of representation learning systems is the projection head, which maps the original embeddings into different, often compressed spaces, while preserving the similarity relationship between vectors. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired projection head that includes a corresponding quantum-inspired similarity metric. Specifically, we map classical embeddings onto quantum states in Hilbert space and introduce a quantum circuit-based projection head to reduce embedding dimensionality. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we extended the BERT language model by integrating our projection head for embedding compression. We compared the performance of embeddings, which were compressed using our quantum-inspired projection head, with those compressed using a classical projection head on information retrieval tasks using the TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 Deep Learning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our quantum-inspired method achieves competitive performance relative to the classical method while utilizing 32 times fewer parameters. Furthermore, when trained from scratch, it notably excels, particularly on smaller datasets. This work not only highlights the effectiveness of the quantum-inspired approach but also emphasizes the utility of efficient, ad hoc low-entanglement circuit simulations within neural networks as a powerful quantum-inspired technique."}, {"paperId": "016b8c0282720192cb12c00db6df2c1b2d8da024", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016b8c0282720192cb12c00db6df2c1b2d8da024", "title": "Using Term-Matching Algorithms for the Annotation of Geo-services", "year": 2009, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

This paper provides an overview of electronic health information systems currently available, and discusses their implications for the dissemination of information for medical practitioners within the context of the health care infrastructure in South Africa."}, {"paperId": "016c58835b9096d5f20c1b6f4ebd90b743c31f1b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016c58835b9096d5f20c1b6f4ebd90b743c31f1b", "title": "Developing a Records and Information Management Model for Oil Marketing Companies in Zambia Based on the Records Cycle Model", "year": 2020, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.4236/ojbm.2020.84114", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4236/ojbm.2020.84114?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4236/ojbm.2020.84114, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

An effective records management system facilitates the flow of \nrecords throughout an organization to ensure that information is available \nreadily where and when it is needed. However, studies have shown that many \norganizations are still faced with challenges in records management. Studies \nhave also shown that delayed retrieval of active records, management policy, up-to-date \nrecords retention and disposal schedule and guidelines for managing electronic \nrecords were among the notable challenges. This study therefore, was aimed at \nidentifying the challenges faced by oil marketing companies in Zambia in \nrecords management. Specifically the study sought to develop a model in order \nto address the identified challenges. The study utilized purposive \nnonprobability sampling with closed ended researcher administered \nquestionnaire. A total of 151 questionnaires were administered with a response \nrate of 53%. The primary data obtained from the questionnaires was analyzed \nusing statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) and Chi-square tests were conducted to establish the level of independence between variables. The \nstudy revealed that, these companies face challenges such as, lack of retention \nand disposal schedule, lack of proper storage facility and security issues of \nthe records. The study has also shown that the organization has no \nformal records management programs in place. It is therefore been realized that \nthe organizations need a better, more efficient and more uniform way of \ncreating, sorting, storing and destroying the records. In filing, bar code \nscanners should be introduced to make identification and storage of records \neasier. These will also help to improve the management control and security \naspect of records management and address most of these challenges faced by oil \nmarketing companies."}, {"paperId": "016c653db77c88dd4b505ba9143a1737049d3f6a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016c653db77c88dd4b505ba9143a1737049d3f6a", "title": "User Interface Cues Based on Eye Gaze Data in Information Retrieval", "year": 2016, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2092995283", "name": "Marta Vasilieva"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "016c7bb5ca8c63fdf9606f36ee27fc8cd12042fa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016c7bb5ca8c63fdf9606f36ee27fc8cd12042fa", "title": "Many Bills: Visualizing the Anatomy of Congressional Legislation", "year": 2011, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2565634", "name": "Elif Aktolga"}, {"authorId": "143830245", "name": "Irene Ros"}, {"authorId": "2867282", "name": "Yannick Assogba"}, {"authorId": "3608574", "name": "J.

Our main contribution is an auxiliary pretext task to STONE, formulated using transposition-invariant chroma features as a source of pseudo-labels. S-KEY matches the supervised state of the art in tonality estimation on FMAKv2 and GTZAN datasets while requiring no human annotation and having the same parameter budget as STONE.

In this paper, we extend question-answering techniques, first studied in the information retrieval literature, to the web and experimentally evaluate their performance.First we introduce Mulder, which we believe to be the first general-purpose, fully-automated question-answering system available on the web. Second, we describe Mulder's architecture, which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally, we compare Mulder's performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that Mulder's recall is more than a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder."}, {"paperId": "016ffeded77cd05abf7acfd26f4d974adf888394", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016ffeded77cd05abf7acfd26f4d974adf888394", "title": "Analisis Kerentanan Bangunan Terhadap Bencana Gempa Bumi Di Kecamatan Gantiwarno Kabupaten Klaten Tahun 2014", "year": 2017, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "117765858", "name": "Nivo Prayogo"}, {"authorId": "147485080", "name": "M.

However, traditional recommendation algorithms ignore the users social relationships and suffer with the cold start problem. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm based on similarity calculation matrix factorization (SCMF) with the consideration of users social relationships and items associated relationships when ratings information is available. At the same time, when ratings information is unavailable, the proposed algorithm can obtain potential feature relationships and makes personalized recommendations. We also introduce a penalty factor of positive items to the similarity calculation equation in case of over fitting. By this way, the SCFM algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy and alleviate the problem of cold start of sparse data. We compared our approach with other 4 algorithms and conducted experiments on 4 common used data sets. Regarding the experimental results, the recommendation precision of SCMF can be improved by 2% to 9% compared with the traditional best algorithm, and by 0.17% to 18% for cold start users. Additionally, our approaches were applied to patent data resource exploitation, provided by Wanfang patent retrieval system. The experimental results also verify the effectiveness of SCMF algorithm in improving recommendation performance."}, {"paperId": "017187c8a7179b7839f8493a1611b0a70091624a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/017187c8a7179b7839f8493a1611b0a70091624a", "title": "Report on the Fourth Workshop on Location and the Web (LocWeb 2014)", "year": 2015, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.
